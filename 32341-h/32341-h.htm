<h2>
CHAPTER I. HYDROPATHIC ACQUAINTANCES.
</h2>
<p>
We are at Como, on the lake&mdash;that spot so beloved of opera dancers&mdash;the
day-dream of prima donnas&mdash;the Elysium of retired barytones! And with
what reason should this be the Paradise of all who have lived and sighed,
and warbled and pirouetted, within the charmed circle of the footlights?
The crystal waters mirroring every cliff and crag with intense
distinctness; the vegetation variegated to the very verge of extravagance;
orange-trees overloaded with fruit; arbutus only too much bespangled with
red berries; villas, more coquettish than ever scene-painter conceived,
with vistas of rooms within, all redolent of luxury; terraces, and
statues, and vases, and fountains, and marble balconies, steeped in a
thousand balmy odours, make up a picture which well may fascinate those
whose ideal of beauty is formed of such gorgeous groupings. There is
something of unreality in the brilliant colouring and variety of the scene
suggesting the notion, that at any moment the tenor may emerge, velvet
mantle and all, from the copse before you; or a prima donna, in all the
dishevelment of her back hair, rush madly to your feet. There is not a
portal from which an angry father may not issue; not a shady walk that
might not be trod by an incensed basso!
</p>
<p>
The rustic bridges seem made for the tiny feet of short-petticoated
damsels, daintily tripping, with white-napkin covered baskets, to soft
music; and every bench appears but waiting for that wearied old peasant,
in blue stockings, a staff, and a leather belt, that has vented his
tiresomeness in the same spot for the last half century. Who wonders, if
the distracted Princess of &ldquo;the scene&rdquo; should love a picture that recalls
the most enthusiastic triumphs of her success? Why should not the retired
&ldquo;Feri&rdquo; like to wander at will through a more enchanting garden than ever
she pirouetted in?
</p>
<p>
Conspicuous amongst the places where these stage-like elements abound is
the Villa d'Este; situated in a little bay, with two jutting promontories
to guard it, the ground offers every possible variety of surface and
elevation. From the very edge of the calm lake, terrace rises above
terrace, clad with all that is rich and beautiful in vegetation; rocks,
and waterfalls, and ruins, and statues abound. Everything that money could
buy, and bad taste suggest, are there heaped with a profusion that is
actually confounding. Every stone stair leads to some new surprise; every
table-land opens some fresh and astonishing prospect. Incongruous,
inharmonious, tea-gardenish as it is, there is still a charm in the spot
which no efforts of the vilest taste seem able to eradicate. The vines <i>will</i>
cluster in graceful groupings; the oranges <i>will</i> glow in gorgeous
contrast to their dark mantle of leaves; water <i>will</i> leap with its
own spontaneous gladness, and fall in diamond showers over a grassy carpet
no emerald ever rivalled; and, more than all, the beautiful lake itself <i>will</i>
reflect the picture, with such softened effects of light and shadow, that
all the perversions of human ingenuity are totally lost in the
transmission.
</p>
<p>
This same Villa d'Este was once the scene of a sad drama; but it is not to
this era in its history we desire now to direct our reader's attention,
but to a period much later, when no longer the home of an exiled Princess,
or the retreat where shame and sorrow abandoned themselves to every
excess, its changed fortune had converted it into an establishment for the
water cure!
</p>
<p>
The prevailing zeal of our day is to simplify everything, even to things
which will not admit of simplicity. What with our local athenæums, our
mechanics' institutes, our lecturing lords and discoursing baronets, we
have done a great deal. Science has been popularised, remote geographies
made familiar, complex machinery explained, mysterious inscriptions
rendered intelligible. How could it be expected that in the general
enthusiasm for useful knowledge medicine should escape, or that its
secrets should be exempt from a scrutiny that has spared nothing? Hence
have sprung up those various sects in the curative art which, professing
to treat rationally and openly what hitherto has been shrouded in
mysticism and deception, have multiplied themselves into grape cures, milk
cures, and water cures, and Heaven knows how many other strange devices
&ldquo;to cheat the ills that flesh is heir to.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
We are not going to quarrel with any of these new religions; we forgive
them much for the simple service they have done, in withdrawing their
followers from the confined air, the laborious life, the dreary toil, or
the drearier dissipation of cities, to the fresh and invigorating breezes,
the cheerful quietude, and the simple pleasures of a country existence.
</p>
<p>
We care little for the regimen or the ritual, be it lentils or asses'
milk, Tyrol grapes, or pure water, so that it be administered on the
breezy mountain side, or in the healthful air of some lofty &ldquo;Plateau&rdquo; away
from the cares, the ambitions, the strife, and the jar-rings of the active
world, with no seductions of dissipation, neither the prolonged
stimulants, nor the late hours of fashion.
</p>
<p>
It was a good thought, too, to press the picturesque into the service of
health, and show the world what benefits may flow, even to nerves and
muscles, from elevated thoughts and refined pleasures. All this is,
however, purely digressionary, since we are more concerned with the social
than the medical aspects of Hydropathy, and so we come back at once to
Como. The sun has just risen, on a fresh morning in autumn, over the tall
mountain east of the lake, making the whole western shore, where the Villa
d'Este stands, all a-glitter with his rays. Every rock, and crag, and
promontory are picked out with a sharp distinctness, every window is
a-blaze, and streams of light shoot into many a grove and copse, as though
glad to pierce their way into cool spots where the noonday sun himself can
never enter. On the opposite shore, a dim and mysterious shadow wraps
every object, faint outlines of tower and palace loom through the
darkness, and a strange hazy depth encloses the whole scene. Such is the
stillness, however, that the opening of a casement, or the plash of a
stone in the water, is heard across the lake, and voices come from the
mysterious gloom with an effect almost preternaturally striking.
</p>
<p>
On a terrace high up above the lake, sheltered with leafy fig-trees and
prickly pears, there walks a gentleman, sniffing the morning air, and
evidently bent on inhaling health at every pore.
</p>
<p>
Nothing in his appearance indicates the invalid; every gesture, as he
moves, rather displays a conscious sense of health and vigour. Somewhat
above the middle size, compactly but not heavily built, it is very
difficult to guess his years; for though his hair and the large whiskers
which meet beneath his chin are perfectly white, his clear blue eyes and
regular teeth show no signs of age. Singularly enough, it is his dress
that gives the clue to this mystery. His tightly-fitting frock, his
bell-shaped hat, and his shapely trousers, all tell of a fashion
antecedent to our loosely-hanging vestments and uncared-for garments; for
the Viscount Lackington was a lord in waiting to the &ldquo;First Gentleman&rdquo; in
Europe at a time when Paletots were unknown, and Jim Crows had not been
imagined.
</p>
<p>
Early as was the hour, his dress was perfect in all its details, and the
accurate folds of his immaculate cravat, and the spotless brilliancy of
his boots, would have done credit to Bond-street in days when Bond-street
cherished such glories. Let our modern critics sneer as they will at the
dandyism of that day, the gentleman of the time was a very distinctive
individual, and, in the subdued colour of his habiliments, their studious
simplicity, and, above all, their unvarying uniformity, utterly defied all
the attempts of spurious imitators.
</p>
<p>
Our story opens only a few years back, and Lord Lackington was then one of
the very few who perpetuated the traditions in costume of that celebrated
period; but he did so with such unerring accuracy, that men actually
wondered where those marvellously shaped hats were made, or how those
creaseless coats were ever fashioned. Even to the perfume of his
handkerchief, the faintest and most evanescent of odours, all were
mysteries that none could penetrate.
</p>
<p>
As he surveyed the landscape through his double eye-glass, he smiled
graciously and blandly, and gently inclined his head, as though to say,
&ldquo;Very prettily done, water and mountains. I'm quite satisfied with you,
trees; you please me very much indeed! Trickle away little fountain&mdash;the
picture is the better for it.&rdquo; His Lordship had soon, however, other
objects to engage his attention than the inanimate constituents of the
scene. The spot which he had selected for his point of view was usually
traversed, in their morning walks, by the other residents of the &ldquo;Cure,&rdquo;
 and this circumstance permitted him to receive the homage of such early
risers as were fain to couple with their pursuit of health the recognition
of a great man.
</p>
<p>
Like poverty, hydropathy makes us acquainted with strange associates. The
present establishment was too recently formed to have acquired any very
distinctive celebrity, but it was sufficiently crowded. There was a great
number of third-rate Italians from the Lombard towns and cities, a
sprinkling of inferior French, a few English, a stray American or so, and
an Irish family, on their way to Italy, sojourning here rather for economy
than health, and fancying that they were acquiring habits and manners that
would serve them through their winter's campaign.
</p>
<p>
The first figure which emerged upon the plateau was that of a man swathed
in great-coat, cap, and worsted wrappers, that it was difficult to guess
what he could be. He came forward at a shambling trot, and was about to
pass on without looking aside, when Lord Lackington called out, &ldquo;Ah!
Spicer, have you got off that eleven pounds yet?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, my Lord, but very
near it. I'm seven stone ten, and at seven eight I'm all right.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Push along, then, and don't lose your training,' said his Lordship,
dismissing him with a bland wave of the hand. And the other made an
attempt at a salutation, and passed on.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Madame la Marquise, your servant. You ascend these mountain steeps like a
chamois!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This compliment was addressed to a little, very fat old lady, who came
snorting along like a grampus.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Benedetto Dottore!&rdquo; cried she. &ldquo;He will have it that I must go up to the
stone cross yonder every morning before breakfast, and I know I shall
burst a blood-vessel yet in the attempt.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A chair, with a mass of horse-clothing and furs, surmounted by a little
yellow wizened face, was next borne by, to which Lord Lackington bowed
courteously, saying, &ldquo;Your Excellency improves at every hour.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
His Excellency gave a brief nod and a little faint smile, swallowed a
mouthful from a silver flask presented by his servant, and disappeared.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah! the fair syren sisters! what a charming vision!&rdquo; said his Lordship,
as two bright-cheeked, laughing-eyed girls bounced upon the terrace in all
the high-hearted enjoyment of good health and good spirits.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Molly, for shame!&rdquo; cried what seemed the elder, a damsel of about
nineteen, as the younger, holding out her dress with both hands, performed
a kind of minuet curtsey to the Viscount, to which he responded with a bow
that might have done credit to Versailles.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Perfectly done&mdash;grace and elegance itself. The foot a little&mdash;a
very little more in advance.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just because you want to look at it,&rdquo; cried she, laughing. &ldquo;Molly,
Molly!&rdquo; exclaimed the other, rebukingly. &ldquo;Let him deny it if he can,
Lucy,&rdquo; retorted she. &ldquo;But here's papa.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And as she spoke, a square-built, short, florid man, fanning his bald head
with a straw hat, puffed his way forward.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My Lord, I'm your most obaydient!&rdquo; said he, with a very unmistakably
Irish enunciation. &ldquo;O'Reilly, I'm delighted to see you. These charming
girls of yours have just put me in good humour with the whole creation.
What a lovely spot this is; how beautiful!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Though his Lordship's arm and outstretched hand directed attention to the
scenery, his eyes never wandered from the pretty features of the laughing
girl beside him.
</p>

</div>
<p>
&ldquo;It's like Banthry!&rdquo; said Mr. O'Reilly&mdash;&ldquo;it's the very ditto of
Banthry.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed my Lord, still pursuing his scrutiny.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Only Banthry's bigger and wider. Indeed, I may say finer.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nothing, in <i>my</i> estimation, can exceed this!&rdquo; said his Lordship,
with a distinctive smile, addressed to the young lady.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm glad you think so,&rdquo; said she, with a merry laugh. And then, with a
pirouette, she sprang up the steep steps on the rocky path before her, and
disappeared, her sister as quickly following, leaving Mr. O'Reilly alone
with his Lordship.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What heaps of money she laid out here,&rdquo; exclaimed O'Reilly, as he looked
at the labyrinth of mad ruins, and rustic bridges, and hanging gardens on
every side of him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Large sums&mdash;very large indeed!&rdquo; said my Lord, whose thoughts were
evidently on some other track.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pure waste&mdash;nothing else; the place never could pay. Vines and
fig-trees, indeed&mdash;I'd rather see a crop of oats.&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have a weakness for the picturesque, I must own,&rdquo; said my Lord, as his
eye still followed the retreating figures of the girls.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I like a waterfall; and, indeed, I like a summer-house myself,&rdquo;
 said O'Reilly, as though confessing to a similar trait on his own part.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;This is the first time you have been abroad, O'Reilly?&rdquo; said his
Lordship, to turn the subject of the conversation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my Lord, my first, and, with God's blessing, my last, too! When I
lost Mrs. O'Reilly, two years ago, of a complaint that beat all the
doctors&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, yes, you mentioned that to me; very singular indeed!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;For it wasn't in the heart itself, my Lord, but in the bag that houlds
it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, I remember the explanation perfectly; so you thought you'd just
come abroad for a little distraction.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Distraction indeed! 'tis the very word for it,&rdquo; broke in Mr. O'Reilly,
eagerly. &ldquo;My head is bewildered between the lingo and the money, and they
keep telling me, 'You'll get used to it, papa, darling&mdash;you'll be
quite at home yet.' But how is that ever possible?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Still, for your charming girls' sake,&rdquo; said my Lord, caressing his
whiskers and adjusting his neckcloth, as if for immediate captivation&mdash;&ldquo;or
their sake, O'Reilly, you've done perfectly right!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I'm glad your Lordship says so. 'Tis nobody ought to know better!&rdquo;
 said he, with a heavy sigh.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They really deserve every cultivation. All the advantages that&mdash;that&mdash;that
sort of thing can bestow!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And his Lordship smiled benignly, as though offering his own aid to the
educational system.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What they said to me was this,&rdquo; said O'Reilly, dropping his voice to a
tone of the most confiding secrecy: &ldquo;'Don't be keeping them down here in
Mary's Abbey, but take them where they'll see life. You can give them
forty thousand pounds between them, Tim O'Reilly, and with that and their
own good looks&mdash;-'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Beauty, O'Reilly&mdash;-downright loveliness,&rdquo; broke in my Lord.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, indeed, they are handsome,&rdquo; said O'Reilly, with an honest
satisfaction, &ldquo;and that's exactly why I thought the advice was good. 'Take
them abroad,' they said; 'take them into Germany and Italy&mdash;but more
especially Italy'&mdash;for they say there's nothing like Italy for
finishing young ladies.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That is certainly the general impression!&rdquo; said his Lordship with the
barest imaginable motion of his nether lip.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And here we are, but where we're going afterwards, and what well do when
we're there, that thief of a Courier we have may know, but I don't.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So that you gave up business, O'Reilly, and resigned yourself freely to a
life of ease,&rdquo; said my Lord, with a smile that seemed to approve the
project.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, indeed, my Lord; but whether it's to be a life of pleasure, I don't
know. I was in the provision trade thirty-eight years, and do you know I
miss the pigs greatly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Every man has a hankering of that sort. Old cosmopolite as I am, I have
every now and then my longing for that window at Brookes's, and that snug
dinner-room at Boodle's.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my Lord,&rdquo; said O'Reilly, who hadn't the faintest conception whether
these localities were not situated in China.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, Twining, never thought to see you here,&rdquo; called out his Lordship to a
singularly tall man, who came forward with such awkward contortions of
legs and arms, as actually to suggest the notion that he was struggling
against somebody. Mr. O'Reilly modestly stole away while the friends were
shaking hands, and we take the same opportunity to, present the new
arrival to our reader.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Adderley Twining was a gentleman of good family and very large
fortune, whose especial pleasure it was to pass off to the world for a
gay, light-hearted, careless creature, of small means, and most lavish
liberality. To be, in fact, perpetually struggling between a most generous
temperament and a narrow purse. His cordiality was extreme, his politeness
unbounded; and as he was most profuse in his pledges for the present and
his promises for the future, he attained to a degree of popularity which
to his own estimation was immense. This was, in fact, the one sole
self-deception of his very crafty nature, and the belief that he was a
universal favourite was the solitary mistake of this shrewd intelligence.
Although a married man, there was so constantly some &ldquo;difficulty&rdquo; or other&mdash;these
were his own words&mdash;about Lady Grace, that they seldom were seen
together; but he spoke of her when absent in terms of the most fervent
affection, but whose health, or spirits, or tastes, or engagements
unhappily denied her the happiness of travelling along with him. Whenever
it chanced that they were together, he scarcely mentioned her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what breeze of fortune has wafted you here, Twining?&rdquo; said his
Lordship, delighted to chance upon a native of his own world.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Health, my Lord,&mdash;health,&rdquo; said he, with one of his ready laughs, as
though everything he said or thought had some comic side in it that amused
him, &ldquo;and a touch of economy too, my Lord.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What humbug all that is, Twining. Who the deuce is so well off as
yourself?&rdquo; said Lord Lackington, with all that peculiar bitterness with
which an embarrassed man listens to the grumblings of a wealthy one.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Only too happy, my Lord&mdash;rejoiced if you were right. Capital news
for me, eh?&mdash;excellent news!&rdquo; And he slapped his lean legs with his
long thin fingers, and laughed immoderately.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come, come, we all know that&mdash;besides a devilish good thing of your
own&mdash;you got the Wrexley estate, and old Poole's Dorsetshire
property. Hang me if I ever open a newspaper without reading that you are
somebody's residuary legatee.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I assure you, solemnly, my Lord, I am actually hard up, pressed for
money, downright inconvenienced.&rdquo; And he laughed again, as though it were
uncommonly droll.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stuff&mdash;nonsense!&rdquo; said my Lord, angrily, for he really was losing
temper; and to change the topic he curtly asked, &ldquo;And where do you mean to
pass the winter?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;In Florence, my Lord, or Naples. We have a little den in both places.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The &ldquo;den&rdquo; in Florence was a sumptuous palace on the Arno. Its brother at
Naples was a royal villa near Posilippo.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why not Rome? Lady Lackington and myself mean to try Rome.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, all very well for you, my Lord, but for people of small fortune&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
There was that in the expression of his Lordship's face that told Twining
this vein might be followed too far, and so he stopped in time, and
laughed away pleasantly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Spicer tells me,&rdquo; resumed Lord Lackington, &ldquo;that Florence is quite
deserted; nothing but a kind of second and third rate set of people go
there. Is that so?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Excellent people, capital society, great fun!&rdquo; said Twining, in a burst
of merriment.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Spicer calls them 'Snobs,' and he ought to know.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So he ought indeed, my Lord&mdash;no one better. Admirably observed, and
very just.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He's in training again for that race that never comes off,&rdquo; said his
Lordship. &ldquo;The first time I ever saw him&mdash;it was at Leamington&mdash;and
he was performing the same farce, with hot baths and blankets, and jotting
down imaginary bets in a small note-book.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How good&mdash;capital! Your Lordship has him perfectly&mdash;you know
him thoroughly&mdash;great fun! Spicer, excellent creature!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How those fellows live is a great mystery to me. You chance upon them
everywhere, in Baden or Aix in summer, in Paris or Vienna during the
winter. Now, if they were amusing rogues, like that fellow I met at your
house in Hampshire&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Stockley, my Lord; rare fellow, quite a genius!&rdquo; laughed Twining.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just so&mdash;Stockley; one would have them just to help over the boredom
of a country house; but this creature Spicer is as devoid of amusing
gifts, as tiresome, and as worn out, as if he owned ten thousand a year.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How good, by Jove!&rdquo; cried Twining, in ecstasy. And he slapped his gaunt
limbs and threw his long arms wildly about in a transport of delight.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And who are here, Twining&mdash;any of our set?&rdquo; &ldquo;Not a soul, my Lord;
the place isn't known yet, that's the reason I came here&mdash;so quiet
and so cheap, make your own terms with them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good fun&mdash;excellent!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>I</i> came to meet a man of business,&rdquo; said his Lordship, with a
strong emphasis on the pronoun. &ldquo;He couldn't prolong his journey farther
south, and so we agreed to rendezvous here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have a little affair also to transact&mdash;a mere trifle, a nothing,
in fact&mdash;with a lawyer, who promises to meet me here by the end of
the month, so that we have just time to take our baths, drink the waters,
and all that sort of thing, while we are waiting.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And he rubbed his hands, and laughed away again.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What a boon for my wife to learn that Lady Grace is here! She was getting
so hipped with the place&mdash;not so much the place as the odious people&mdash;that
I suspect she'd have left me to wait for Dunn all alone.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Dunn! Dunn! not Davenport Dunn?&rdquo; exclaimed Twining.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The very man&mdash;do you know him?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure, he's the fellow I'm waiting for. Capital fun, isn't it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And he slapped his legs again, while he repeated the name of Dunn over and
over again.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I want to know something about this same Mr. Dunn,&rdquo; said Lord Lackington,
confidentially.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So do I; like it of all things,&rdquo; cried Twining. &ldquo;Clever fellow-wonderful
fellow&mdash;up to everything&mdash;acquainted with everybody. Great fun!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He occupies a very distinguished position in Ireland, I fancy,&rdquo; said his
Lordship, with such a marked stress on the locality as to show that such
did not constitute an imperial reputation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes, man of the day there; do what he likes; very popular&mdash;immensely
popular!&rdquo; said Twining, as he laughed on.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So that you know no more of him than his public repute&mdash;-no more
than I know myself,&rdquo; said his Lordship.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not so much as your Lordship, I'm certain,&rdquo; said Twining, as though it
would have been unbecoming in him to do so; &ldquo;in fact, my business
transactions are such mere nothings, that it's quite a kindness on his
part to undertake them&mdash;trifles, no more!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And Twining almost hugged himself in the ecstasy which his last words
suggested.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Mine</i>,&rdquo; said Lord Lackington, haughtily, &ldquo;are of consequence enough
to fetch him hither&mdash;a good thousand miles away from England; but he
is pretty certain of its being well worth his while, to come.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Quite convinced of that&mdash;could swear it,&rdquo; said Twining, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here are a mob of insufferable bores,&rdquo; said his Lordship, testily, as a
number of people were heard approaching, for somehow&mdash;it is not easy
to say exactly why&mdash;he had got into a train of thought that scorned
to worry him, and was not disposed to meet strangers; and so, with a brief
gesture of good-by to Twining, he turned into a path and disappeared.
</p>
<p>
Twining looked after him for a second or two, and then slapping his legs,
he muttered, pleasantly, &ldquo;What fun!&rdquo; and took the road towards the house.

<h2>
CHAPTER II. HOW TWO &ldquo;FINE LADIES&rdquo; PASS THE MORNING.
</h2>
<p>
In a room of moderate size, whose furniture was partly composed of bygone
finery and some articles of modern comfort&mdash;a kind of compromise
between a Royal residence and a Hydropathic establishment&mdash;sat two
ladies at an open window, which looked out upon a small terrace above the
lake. The view before them could scarcely have been surpassed in Europe.
Enclosed, as in a frame, between the snow-clad Alps and the wooded
mountains of the Brianca, lay the lake, its shores one succession of
beautiful villas, whose gardens descended to the very water. Although the
sun was high, the great mountains threw the shadows half way across the
lake; and in the dim depth of shade, tower and crag, battlement and
precipice, were strangely intermixed, giving to the picture a mysterious
grandeur that contrasted strongly with the bright reality of the opposite
shore, where fruit and flowers, gay tapestries from casements, and
floating banners, added colour to the scene.
</p>
<p>
Large white-sailed boats stole peacefully along, loaded, half-mast high,
with water-melons and garden stores; the golden produce glittering in the
sun, and glowing in the scarcely rippled water beneath them, while the low
chant of the boatmen floated softly and lazily through the air&mdash;meet
sounds in a scene where all seemed steeped in a voluptuous repose.
</p>
<p>
The two ladies whom we have mentioned were not impassioned spectators of
the scene. Whenever their eyes ranged over it, no new brilliancy awoke in
them, no higher colour tinged their cheek. One was somewhat advanced in
life, but with many traces of beauty, and an air which denoted a lifelong
habit of homage and deference.
</p>
<p>
There was that in her easy, lounging attitude, and the splendour of her
dress, which seemed to intimate that Lady Lackington would still be
graceful, and even extravagant, though there were none to admire the grace
or be dazzled by the costliness. Her companion, though several years
younger, looked, from the effects of delicate health and a suffering
disposition, almost of her own age. She, too, was handsome; but it was a
beauty which so much depended on tint and colour, that her days of
indisposition left her almost bereft of good looks. All about her, her
low, soft voice, her heavily raised eyelids, her fair and blue-veined
hands, the very carriage of her head, pensively thrown forwards, were so
many protestations of one who asked for sympathy and compassion; and who,
whether with reason or without, firmly believed herself the most unhappy
creature in existence.
</p>
<p>
If there was no great similarity of disposition to unite them, there was a
bond fully as strong. They were both English of the same order, both born
and bred up in a ritual that dictates its own notions of good or bad, of
right and wrong, of well-bred and vulgar, of riches and poverty. Given any
person in society, or any one event of their lives, and these two ladies'
opinion upon either would have been certain to harmonise and agree. The
world for them had but one aspect; for the simple reason, that they had
always seen it from the one same point of view. They had not often met;
they had seen very little of each other for years; but the freemasonry of
class supplied all the place of affection, and they were as fond and as
confiding as though they were sisters.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I must say,&rdquo; said the Viscountess, in a tone full of reprobation, &ldquo;that
is shocking&mdash;actually shameful; and, in <i>your</i> place, I'd not
endure it!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have become so habituated to sorrow,&rdquo; sighed Lady Grace
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That you will sink under it at last, my dear, if this man's cruelties be
not put an end to. You really must allow me to speak to Lackington.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It wouldn't be of the slightest service, I assure you. In the first
place, he is so plausible, he'd persuade any one that there was nothing to
complain of, that he lived up to his fortune, that his means were actually
crippled; and secondly, he'd give such pledges for the future, such
promises, that it would be downright rudeness to throw a doubt on their
sincerity.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why did you marry him, my dear?&rdquo; said Lady Lackington, with a little
sigh.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I married him to vex Ridout; we had a quarrel at that <i>fête</i> at
Chiswick, you remember, Tollertin's <i>fête</i>. Ridout was poor, and felt
his poverty. I don't believe I treated his scruples quite fairly. I know I
owned to him that I had no contempt for riches&mdash;that I thought
Belgrave-square, and the Opera, and Diamonds, and a smart Equipage, all
very commendable things: and Jack said, 'Then, there's your man. Twining
has twenty thousand a year.' 'But, he has not asked me,' said I, laughing.
Ridout turned away without a word. Half an hour later, Mr. Adderley
Twining formally proposed for my hand, and was accepted.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And Jack Ridout is now the Marquis of Allerton,&rdquo; said Lady Lackington.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I know it!&rdquo; said the other, bitterly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;With nigh forty thousand a year.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I know it!&rdquo; cried she, again.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And the handsomest house and the finest park in England.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The other burst into tears, and hid her face between her hands.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There's a fate in these things, my dear,&rdquo; said Lady Lackington, with a
slight paleness creeping over her cheek. &ldquo;That's all we can say about
them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What have you done with that sweet place in Hampshire?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Dingley? It is let to Lord Mauley.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you had a house in St. James's-square.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is Burridge's Hotel, now.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Lady Lackington fanned her swarthy face for some seconds, and then said,
&ldquo;And how did you come here?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We saw&mdash;that is, Twining saw&mdash;an advertisement of this new
establishment in the <i>Galignani</i>. We had just arrived at Liége, when
he discovered a vetturino returning to Milan with an empty carriage; he
accordingly bargained with him to take us on here&mdash;I forget for what
sum&mdash;so that we left our own carriage, and half my luggage, at the
Pavilion Hotel, and set off on our three weeks' journey. We have been
three weeks all but two days on the road! My maid of course refused to
travel in this fashion, and went back to Paris. Courcel, his own man,
rebelled too, which Twining, I must say, seemed overjoyed at, and gave him
such a character for honesty in consequence, as he never could have hoped
for; and so we came on, with George the footman, and a Belgian creature I
picked up at the hotel, who, except to tear out my hair when she brushes
it, and bruise me whenever she hooks a dress, has really no other gift
under heaven.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you actually came all this way by vetturino?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Lady Grace nodded a sad assent, and sighed deeply.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What does he mean by it, my dear? The man must have some deep, insidious
design in all this;&mdash;don't you think so?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I think to myself, sometimes,&rdquo; replied she, sorrowfully. And now their
eyes met, and they remained looking steadily at each other for some
seconds. Whatever Lady Grace's secret thoughts, or whatever the dark
piercing orbs of her companion served to intimate, true is it that she
blushed till her cheek became crimson; and as she arose, and walked out
upon the terrace, her neck was a-flame with the emotion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He never married?&rdquo; said Lady Lackington.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Lady Grace, without turning her head. And there was a silence
on both sides.
</p>
<p>
Oh dear! how much of the real story of our lives passes without expression&mdash;how
much of the secret mechanism of our hearts moves without a sound in the
machinery!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; said Lady Lackington, at last, &ldquo;his lot is just as sad as
your own. I mean,&rdquo; added she, &ldquo;that he feels it so.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
There was no answer, and she resumed. &ldquo;Not but men generally treat these
things lightly enough. They have their clubs, and their Houses of
Parliament, and their shooting. Are you ill, dearest?&rdquo; cried she, as Lady
Grace tottered feebly back and sauk into a chair.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she, in a faint voice, &ldquo;I'm only tired!&rdquo; And there was an
inexpressible melancholy in the tone as she spoke it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And I'm tired too!&rdquo; said Lady Lackington, drearily. &ldquo;There is a tyranny
in the routine of these places quite insupportable&mdash;the hours, the
discipline, the diet, and, worse than all, the dreadful people one meets
with.&rdquo; Though Lady Grace did not seem very attentive, this was a theme the
speaker loved to improve, and so she proceeded to discuss the house and
its inhabitants in all freedom. French, Russians, and Italians&mdash;all
were passed in review, and very smartly criticised, till she arrived at
&ldquo;those atrocious O'Reillys, that my Lord will persist in threatening to
present to me. Now one knows horrid people when they are very rich, or
very well versed in some speculation or other&mdash;mines, or railroads,
or the like&mdash;and when their advice is so much actual money in your
pocket&mdash;just, for instance, as my Lord knows that Mr. Davenport Dunn&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh! he's a great ally of Mr. Twining; at least, I have heard his name a
hundred times in connexion with business matters.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You never saw him?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nor I, but once; but I confess to have some curiosity to know him. They
tell me he can do anything he pleases with each House of Parliament, and
has no inconsiderable influence in a sphere yet higher. It is quite
certain that the old Duke of Wycombe's affairs were all set to rights by
his agency, and Lady Muddleton's divorce bill was passed by his means.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The word &ldquo;divorce&rdquo; seemed to rally Lady Grace from her fit of musing, and
she said, &ldquo;Is that certain?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Julia herself says so, that's all. He got a bill, or an act, or clause,
or whatever you call it, inserted, by which she succeeded in her suit, and
she is now as free&mdash;as free&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;As I am not!&rdquo; broke in Lady Grace, with a sad effort at a smile.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure, there is a little scandal in the matter, too. They say that
old Lord Brookdale was very 'soft' himself in that quarter.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Chancellor!&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Grace.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And why not, dear? You remember the old refrain, 'No age, no station'&mdash;what
is it?&mdash;and the next line goes&mdash;'To sovereign beauty mankind
bends the knee.' Julia is rather proud of the triumph herself; she says it
is like a victory in China, where the danger is very little and the spoils
considerable!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Spicer, my Lady,&rdquo; said a servant, entering, &ldquo;wishes to know if your
Ladyship will receive him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not this morning; say I'm engaged at present Tell him&mdash;But perhaps
you have no objection&mdash;shall we have him in?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just as you please. I don't know him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Lady Lackington whispered a word or two, and then added aloud, &ldquo;And one
always finds them 'useful,' my dear!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mr. Spicer, when denuded of top-coat, cap, and woollen wrapper, as we saw
him last, was a slightly made man, middle-sized, and middle-aged, with an
air sufficiently gentlemanlike to pass muster in any ordinary assemblage.
To borrow an illustration from the pursuits he was versed in, he bore the
same relation to a man of fashion that a &ldquo;weed&rdquo; does to a &ldquo;winner of the
Derby&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, to an uneducated eye, there would have seemed
some resemblance; and just as the &ldquo;weed&rdquo; counterfeits the racer in a
certain loose awkwardness of stride and an ungainly show of power, so did
he appear to have certain characteristics of a class that he merely mixed
with on sufferance, and imitated in some easy &ldquo;externals.&rdquo; The language of
any profession is, however, a great leveller; and whether the cant be of
the &ldquo;House,&rdquo; Westminster Hall, the College of Physicians, the Mess Table,
or the &ldquo;Turf,&rdquo; it is exceedingly difficult at first blush to distinguish
the real practitioner from the mere pretender. Now, Spicer was what is
called a Gentleman Rider, and he had all the slang of his craft, which is,
more or less, the slang of men who move in a very different sphere.
</p>
<p>
As great landed proprietors of ambitious tendencies will bestow a
qualification to sit in Parliament upon some man of towering abilities and
small fortune, so did certain celebrities of the Turf confer a similar
social qualification on Spicer; and by enabling him to &ldquo;associate with the
world,&rdquo; empower themselves to utilise his talents and make use of his
capabilities. In this great Parliament of the Field, therefore, Spicer
sat; and though for a very small and obscure borough, yet he had his
place, and was &ldquo;ready when wanted.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How d'ye do, Spicer?&rdquo; said Lady Lackington, arranging the folds of her
dress as he came forward, and intimating by the action that he was not to
delude himself into any expectation of touching her hand. &ldquo;My Lord told me
you were here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Spicer bowed, and muttered, and looked, as though he were waiting to be
formally presented to the other lady in company; but Lady Lackington had
not the most remote intention of bestowing on him such a mark of
recognition, and merely answered the mute appeal of his features by a dry
&ldquo;Won't you sit down?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And Mr. Spicer did sit down, and of a verity his position denoted no
excess of ease or enjoyment. It was not that he did not attempt to appear
perfectly at home, that he did not assume an attitude of the very calmest
self-possession, maybe he even passed somewhat the frontier of the
lackadaisical territory he assumed, for he slapped his boot with his whip
in a jaunty affectation of indifference.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pray, don't do that!&rdquo; said Lady Lackington; &ldquo;it worries one!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He desisted, and a very awkward silence of some seconds ensued; at length
she said, &ldquo;There was something or other I wanted to ask you about; you
can't help me to it, can you?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm afraid not, my Lady. Was it anything about sporting matters?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no; but now that you remind me, all that information you gave me
about Glaucus was wrong, he came in 'a bad third.' My Lord laughed at me
for losing my money on him, and said he was the worst horse of the lot.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very sorry to differ with his Lordship,&rdquo; said Spicer, deferentially, &ldquo;but
he was the favourite up to Tuesday evening, when Scott declared that he'd
win with Big the Market. I then tried to get four to one on Flycatcher, to
square your book, but the stable was nobbled.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Did you ever hear such jargon, my dear?&rdquo; said Lady Lackington. &ldquo;You don't
understand one syllable of it, I'm certain.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Spicer smirked and made a slight approach to a bow, as though even this
reference to him would serve for an introduction; but Lady Grace met the
advance with a haughty stare and a look, that said, as plainly as any
words, &ldquo;At your peril, Sir!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
<a name="linkimage-0002" id="linkimage-0002">
<!-- IMG --></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
<img src="images/10044.jpg" width="100%" alt=" 044 " />
</div>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, one thing is certain!&rdquo; said Lady Lackington, &ldquo;nothing that you
predicted turned out afterwards. Glaucus was beaten, and I lost my three
hundred pounds&mdash;only fancy, dearest, three hundred pounds, with which
one could do so many things! I wanted it in fifty ways, and I never
contemplated leaving it with the legs at Newmarket.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not the legs, I assure you, my Lady&mdash;not the legs. I made your book
with Colonel Stamford and Gore Middleton&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;As if I cared who won it!&rdquo; said she, haughtily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I never knew that you tempted fortune in this fashion!&rdquo; said Lady Grace,
languidly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I do so very rarely, my dear. I think Mining Shares are better, or
Guatemala State Bonds. I realised very handsomely indeed upon them two
years ago. To be sure it was Dunn that gave me the hint: he dined with us
at the Hôtel de Windsor, and I asked him to pay a small sum for me to
Hore's people, and when I counted the money out to him, he said, 'Why not
buy in some of those Guanaxualo shares; they'll be up to&mdash;' I forget
what he said&mdash;'before a month. Let Storr wait, and you'll pay him in
full.' And he was quite right, aas I told you. I realised about eight
hundred pounds on my venture.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If Glaucus had won, my Lady&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Don't tell me what I should have gained,&rdquo; broke she in. &ldquo;It only provokes
one the more, and above all, Spicer, no more information, I detest
'information.' And now, what was it I had to say to you; really <i>your</i>
memory would seem to be failing you completely. What could it be?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It couldn't be that roan filly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course it couldn't. I really must endeavour to persuade you that my
thoughts occasionally stray beyond the stable. By the way, you sold those
grey carriage-horses for nothing. You always told me they were the
handsomest pair in London, and yet you say I'm exceedingly lucky to get
one hundred and eighty pounds for them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You forget, my Lady, that Bloomfield was a roarer&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, you really are in a tormenting mood this morning, Spicer. Just
bethink you, now, if there's anything more you have to say, disagreeable
and unpleasant, and say it at once; you have made lady Grace quite ill&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, only tired!&rdquo; sighed her friend, with a melancholy smile.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now I remember,&rdquo; cried Lady Lackington, &ldquo;it was about that house at
Florence. I don't think we shall pass any time there, but in case we
should, I should like that Zapponi palace, with the large terrace on the
Arno, and there must be no one on the ground-floor, mind that; and I'll
not give more than I gave formerly&mdash;perhaps not so much. But, above
all, remember, that if we decide to go on to Rome, that I'm not bound to
it in the least, and he must new-carpet that large drawing-room, and I
must have the little boudoir hung in blue, with muslin over it, not pink.
Pink is odious, except in a dressing-room. You will yourself look to the
stables; they require considerable alteration, and there's something about
the dining-room&mdash;what was it?&mdash;Lord Lackington will remember it.
But perhaps I have given you as many directions as your head will bear.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I almost think so too, my Lady,&rdquo; muttered he, with a half-dogged look.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And be sure, Spicer, that we have that cook&mdash;Antoine&mdash;if we
should want him. Don't let him take a place till we decide where we shall
stop.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are aware that he insists on a hundred and fifty francs a month, and
his wine.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I should like to know what good you are, if I am to negotiate with these
creatures myself!&rdquo; said she, haughtily. &ldquo;I must say, Lady Grace will
suspect that I have rather overrated your little talents, Spicer.&rdquo; And
Lady Grace gave a smile that might mean any amount of approval or
depreciation required. &ldquo;I shall not want that saddle now, and you must
make that man take it back again.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I fear, my Lady&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There, don't be tiresome! What is that odious bell? Oh, it's the dinner
of these creatures. You dine at the table d'hôte, I think, so pray don't
let us keep you. You can drop in to-morrow. Let me see, about two, or
half-past. Good-by&mdash;good-by.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And so Mr. Spicer retired. The bow Lady Grace vouchsafed being in reality
addressed rather to one of the figures on her fan than to himself.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;One gets a habit of these kind of people,&rdquo; said Lady Lackington, as the
door closed after him; &ldquo;but really it is a bad habit.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I think so too,&rdquo; said Lady Grace, languidly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure, there are now and then occasions when you can't employ
exactly a servant. There are petty negotiations which require a certain
delicacy of treatment, and there, they are useful. Besides,&rdquo; said she,
with a half-sneering laugh, &ldquo;there's a fashion in them, and, like Blenheim
spaniels, every one must have one, and the smaller the better!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Monsignore Clifford my Lady, to know if you receive,&rdquo; said a servant,
entering.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, certainly. I'm charmed, my dear Grace, to present to you the most
agreeable man of all Rome. He is English, but 'went over,' as they call
it, and is now high in the Pope's favour.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
These words, hurriedly uttered as they were, had been scarcely spoken when
the visitor entered the room. He was a tall, handsome man, of about
five-and-thirty, dressed in deep black, and wearing a light blue ribbon
across his white neckcloth. He advanced with all the ease of good
breeding, and taking Lady Lackington's hand, he kissed the tips of her
fingers with the polished grace of a courtier.
</p>
<p>
After a formal presentation to Lady Grace, he took a seat between the two
ladies.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am come on, for <i>me</i>, a sad errand, my Lady,&rdquo; said he, in a voice
of peculiar depth and sweetness, in which the very slightest trace of a
foreign accent was detectable&mdash;&ldquo;it is to say good-by!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You quite shock me, Monsignore. I always hoped you were here for our own
time.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I believed and wished it also, my Lady; but I have received a peremptory
order to return to Rome. His Holiness desires to see me at once. There is
some intention, I understand, of naming me as the Nuncio at Florence. Of
course this is a secret as yet.&rdquo; And he turned to each of the ladies in
succession.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that would be charming&mdash;at least for any one happy enough to fix
their residence there, and my friend Lady Grace is one of the fortunate.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Monsignore bowed in gratitude to the compliment, but contrived, as he bent
his head, to throw a covert glance at his future neighbour, with the
result of which he did not seem displeased.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I must of course, then, send you back those interesting books, which I
have only in part read?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;By no means, my Lady; they are yours, if you will honour me by accepting
them. If the subject did not forbid the epithet, I should call them
trifles.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Monsignore insists on my reading the 'Controversy,' dear Lady Grace; but
how I am to continue my studies without his guidance&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We can correspond, my Lady,&rdquo; quickly broke in the other. &ldquo;You can state
to me whatever doubts&mdash;difficulties, perhaps, were, the better word&mdash;occur
to you; I shall be but too happy and too proud to offer you the solution;
and if my Lady Grace Twining would condescend to accept me in the same
capacity&mdash;.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She bowed blandly, and he went on.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is a little tract here, by the Cardinal Balbi&mdash;'Flowers of St.
Joseph' is the title. The style is simple but touching&mdash;'the
invitation' scarcely to be resisted.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I think you told me I should like the Cardinal personally,&rdquo; broke in Lady
Lackington.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;His Eminence is charming, my Lady&mdash;such goodness, such gentleness,
and so much of the very highest order of conversational agreeability.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Monsignore is so polite as to promise us introductions at Rome,&rdquo;
 continued she, addressing Lady Grace, &ldquo;and amongst those, too, who are
never approached by our countrymen.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Alterini, the Fornisari, the Balbetti,&rdquo; proudly repeated Monsignore.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;All ultra-exclusives, you understand,&rdquo; whispered Lady Lacking-ton to her
friend, &ldquo;who wouldn't tolerate the English.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How charming!&rdquo; ejaculated Lady Grace, with a languid enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Roman nobility,&rdquo; continued Lady Lackington, &ldquo;stands proudly forward,
as the only society in Europe to which the travelling English cannot
obtain access.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They have other prejudices, my Lady&mdash;if I may so dare to call
sentiments inspired by higher influences&mdash;than those which usually
sway society. These prejudices are all in favour of such as regard our
Church, if not with the devotion of true followers, at least with the
respect and veneration that rightfully attach to the first-born of
Christianity.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lady Lackington, as, though not knowing very well to what, she
gave her assent, and then added, &ldquo;I own to you I have always experienced a
sort of awe&mdash;a sense of&mdash;what shall I call it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Devotion, my Lady,&rdquo; blandly murmured Monsignore, while his eyes were
turned on her with a paraphrase of the sentiment.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just so. I have always felt it on entering one of your churches&mdash;the
solemn stillness, the gloomy indistinctness, the softened tints, the
swelling notes of the organ&mdash;you know what I mean.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And when such emotions are etherialised, when, rising above material
influences, they are associated with thoughts of what is alone
thought-worthy, with hopes of what alone dignifies hope, imagine, then,
the blessed beatitude, the heavenly ecstasy they inspire.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Monsignore had now warmed to his work, and very ingeniously sketched out
the advantages of a creed that accommodated itself so beautifully to every
temperament&mdash;that gave so much and yet exacted so little&mdash;that
poisoned no pleasures&mdash;discouraged no indulgences&mdash;but left
every enjoyment open with its price attached to it, just as objects are
ticketed in a bazaar. He had much to say, too, of its soothing
consolations&mdash;its devices to alleviate sorrow and cheat affliction&mdash;while
such was its sympathy for poor suffering humanity, that even the very
caprices of temper&mdash;the mere whims of fancied depression&mdash;were
not deemed unworthy of its pious care.
</p>
<p>
It is doubtful whether these ladies would have accorded to a divine of
their own persuasion the same degree of favour and attention that they now
bestowed on Monsignore Clifford. Perhaps his manner in discussing certain
belongings of his Church was more entertaining; perhaps, too&mdash;we hint
it with deference&mdash;that there was something like a forbidden pleasure
in thus trespassing into the domain of Rome. His light and playful style
was, however, a fascination amply sufficient to account for the interest
he excited. If he dwelt but passingly on the dogmas of his Church, he was
eloquently diffuse on its millinery. Copes, stoles, and vestments he
revelled in; and there was a picturesque splendour in his description of
ceremonial that left the best-&ldquo;effects&rdquo; of the opera far behind. How
gloriously, too, did he expatiate on the beauty of the Madonna, the
costliness of her gems, and the brilliancy of her diadem! How incidentally
did he display a rapturous veneration for loveliness, and a very pretty
taste in dress! In a word, as they both confessed, &ldquo;he was charming.''
There was a downy softness in his enthusiasm, a sense of repose even in
his very insistence, peculiarly pleasant to those who like to have their
sensations, like their perfumes, as weak and as faint as possible.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is a tact and delicacy about these men from which our people might
take a lesson,&rdquo; said Lady Lackington, as the door closed after him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; sighed Lady Grace; &ldquo;ours are really dreadful.&rdquo;

<h2>
CHAPTER III. A FATHER AND A DAUGHTER.
</h2>
<p>
A DREARY evening late in October, a cold thin rain falling, and a low
wailing wind sighing through the headless branches of the trees in Merrion
Square, made Dublin seem as sad-looking and deserted as need be. The
principal inhabitants had not yet returned to their homes for the winter,
and the houses wore that melancholy look of vacancy and desertion so
strikingly depressing. One sound alone woke the echoes in that silence; it
was a loud knocking at the door of a large and pretentious mansion in the
middle of the north side of the square. Two persons had been standing at
the door for a considerable time, and by every effort of knocker and bell
endeavoring to obtain admittance. One of these was a tall, erect man of
about fifty, whose appearance but too plainly indicated that most painful
of all struggles between poverty and a certain pretension. White-seamed
and threadbare as was his coat, he wore it buttoned to the top with a sort
of military smartness, his shabby hat was set on with a kind of jaunty
air, and his bushy whiskers, combed and frizzed out with care, seemed a
species of protest against being thought as humble as certain details of
dress might bespeak him. At his side stood a young girl, so like him that
a mere glance proclaimed her to be his daughter; and although in her
appearance, also, narrow means stood confessed, there was an unmistakable
something in her calm, quiet features and her patient expression that
declared she bore her lot with a noble and high-hearted courage.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;One trial more, Bella, and I 'll give it up,&rdquo; cried he, angrily, as,
seizing the knocker, he shook the strong door with the rapping, while he
jingled the bell with equal violence. &ldquo;If they don't come now, it is
because they 've seen who it is, or, maybe&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There, see, papa, there's a window opening above,&rdquo; said the girl,
stepping out into the rain as she spoke.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What d' ye mean,&mdash;do ye want to break in the door?&rdquo; cried a harsh
voice, as the wizened, hag-like face of a very dirty old woman appeared
from the third story.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I want to know if Mr. Davenport Dunn is at home,&rdquo; cried the man.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He is not; he 's abroad,&mdash;in France.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;When is he expected back?&rdquo; asked he again.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe in a week, maybe in three weeks.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Have any letters come for Mr. Kellett&mdash;Captain Kel-lett?&rdquo; said he,
quickly correcting himself.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And a bang of the window, as the head was withdrawn, finished the
colloquy.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's pretty conclusive, any way, Bella,&rdquo; said he, with an attempt to
laugh. &ldquo;I suppose there's no use in staying here longer. Poor child,&rdquo;
 added he, as he watched her preparations against the storm, &ldquo;you 'll be
wet to the skin! I think we must take a car,&mdash;eh, Bella? I <i>will</i>
take a car.&rdquo; And he put an emphasis on the word that sounded like a firm
resolve.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no, papa; neither of us ever feared rain.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And, by George! it can't spoil our clothes, Bella,&rdquo; said he, laughing
with a degree of jocularity that sounded astonishing, even to himself; for
he quickly added, &ldquo;But I <i>will</i> have a car; wait a moment here, under
the porch, and I 'll get one.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And before she could interpose a word, he was off and away, at a speed
that showed the vigor of a younger man.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It won't do, Bella,&rdquo; he said, as he came back again; &ldquo;there's only one
fellow on the stand, and he 'll not go under half a crown. I pushed him
hard for one-and-sixpence, but he 'd not hear of it, and so I thought&mdash;that
was, I knew well&mdash;you would be angry with me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course, papa; it would be mere waste of money,&rdquo; said she, hastily. &ldquo;An
hour's walk,&mdash;at most, an hour and a half,&mdash;and there's an end
of it And now let us set out, for it is growing late.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
There were few in the street as they passed along; a stray creature or so,
houseless and ragged, shuffled onward; an odd loiterer stood for shelter
in an archway, or a chance passer-by, with ample coat and umbrella, seemed
to defy the pelting storm, while cold and dripping they plodded along in
silence.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's old Barrington's house, Bella,&rdquo; said he, as they passed a large
and dreary-looking mansion at the corner of the square; &ldquo;many's the
pleasant evening I spent in it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She muttered something, but inaudibly, and they went on as before.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wonder what 's going on here to-day. It was Sir Dyke Morris used to
live here when I knew it&rdquo; And he stopped at an open door, where a flood of
light poured forth into the street &ldquo;That's the Bishop of Derry, Bella,
that's just gone in. There's a dinner-party there to-day,&rdquo; whispered he,
as, half reluctant to go, he still peered into the hall.
</p>
<p>
She drew him gently forward, and he seemed to have fallen into a revery,
as he muttered at intervals,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Great times&mdash;fine times&mdash;plenty of money&mdash;and fellows that
knew how to spend it!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Drearily plashing onward through wind and rain, their frail clothes soaked
through, they seldom interchanged a word.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Lord Drogheda lived there, Bella,&rdquo; said he, stopping short at the door of
a splendidly illuminated hotel; &ldquo;and I remember the time I was as free and
welcome in it as in my own house. My head used to be full of the strange
things that happened there once. Brown, and Barry Fox, and Tisdall, and
the rest of us, were wild chaps! Faith, my darling, it was n't for Mr.
Davenport Dunn I cared in those times, or the like of him. Davenport Dunn,
indeed!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is strange that he has not written to us,&rdquo; said the girl, in a low
voice.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not a bit strange; it's small trouble he takes about us. I'll bet a
five-pound note&mdash;I mean, I'll lay sixpence,&rdquo; said he, correcting
himself with some confusion,&mdash;&ldquo;that since he left this he never as
much as bestowed a thought on us. When he got me that beggarly place in
the Custom House, he thought he 'd done with me out and out. Sixty pounds
a year! God be with the time I gave Peter Harris, the butler, just double
the money!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
As they talked thus, they gained the outskirts of the city, and gradually
left the lamps and the well-lighted shops behind. Their way now led along
a dreary road by the sea-side, towards the little bathing-village of
Clontarf, beyond which, in a sequestered spot called the Green Lanes,
their humble home stood. It was a long and melancholy walk; the sorrowful
sounds of the sea beating on the shingly strand mingling with the dreary
plashing of the rain; while farther out, a continuous roar as the waves
rolled over the &ldquo;North Bull,&rdquo; added all the terrors of storm to the
miseries of the night.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The winter is setting in early,&rdquo; said Kellett &ldquo;I think I never saw a
severer night.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A sad time for poor fellows out at sea!&rdquo; said the girl, as she turned her
head towards the dreary waste of cloud and water now commingled into one.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;'T is exactly like our own life, out there,&rdquo; cried he: &ldquo;a little glimpse
of light glimmering every now and then through the gloom, but yet not
enough to cheer the heart and give courage; but all black darkness on
every side.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There will come a daybreak at last,&rdquo; said the girl, assuredly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faith! I sometimes despair about it in our own case,&rdquo; said he, sighing
drearily. &ldquo;To think of what I was once, and what I am now! buffeted about
and ill used by a set of scoundrels that I 'd not have suffered to sit
down in my kitchen. Keep that rag of a shawl across your chest; you 'll be
destroyed entirely, Bella.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We'll soon be within shelter now, and nothing the worse for this weather,
either of us,&rdquo; replied she, almost gayly. &ldquo;Over and over again have you
told me what severe seasons you have braved in the hunting-field; and,
after all, papa, one can surely endure as much for duty as in pursuit of
pleasure,&mdash;not to say that our little cottage never looks more
homelike than after a night like this.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's snug enough for a thing of the kind,&rdquo; murmured he, half reluctantly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And Betty will have such a nice fire for us, and we shall be as
comfortable and as happy as though it were a fine house, and we ourselves
fine folk to live in it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Kelletts of Kellett's Court, and no better blood in Ireland,&rdquo; said
he, sternly. &ldquo;It was in the same house my grandfather, Morgan Kellett,
entertained the Duke of Portland, the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland; and this
day, as I stand here, there isn't a chap in the Castle-yard would touch
his hat to me!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what need have we of them, papa? Will not our pride of good blood
teach us other lessons than repining? Can't we show the world that a
gentleman born bears his altered fortunes with dignity?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ye're right, Bella; that's the very thing they must acknowledge. There is
n't a day passes that I don't make the clerks in the 'Long Room' feel the
difference between us. 'No liberties, no familiarities, my lads,' I say,&mdash;'keep
your distance; for, though my coat is threadbare, and my hat none of the
best, the man inside there is Paul Kellett of Kellett's Court.' And if
they ask where that is, I say, 'Look at the Gazetteer,'&mdash;it's mighty
few of them has their names there: 'Kellett's Court, the ancient seat of
the Kellett family, was originally built by Strongbow, Earl of Pembroke.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, here we are, papa, in a more humble home; but you'll see how cheery
it will be.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And so saying, she pushed open a little wicket, and, passing through a
small garden, gained the door of a little one-storied cottage, almost
buried in honeysuckle.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Betty, wet through!&rdquo; said she, laughing, as the old woman held up
her hands in horror; &ldquo;but get papa his slippers and that warm
dressing-gown, and I 'll be back in a minute.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Arrah! why didn't you take a car for her?&rdquo; said the old woman, with that
familiarity which old and tried service warrants. &ldquo;Sure the child will get
her death from this!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She wouldn't let me; she insisted on walking on her feet.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ayeh, ayeh!&rdquo; mattered the crone, as she placed his slippers on the
fender, &ldquo;sure ye oughtn't to mind her. She'd get a fever rather than cost
you a shilling. Look at the shoes she's wearin'.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;By the good day! you'll drive me mad, clean mad!&rdquo; cried he, savagely.
&ldquo;Don't you know in your heart that we have n't got it? Devil a rap
farthing; that we're as poor as a church mouse; that if it wasn't for this
beggarly place&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now, Betty,&rdquo; cried the girl, entering,&mdash;&ldquo;now for our tea, and that
delicious potato-cake that I see browning there before the fire.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Poorly, even meanly dressed as she was, there was in her that gentle look,
and graceful, quiet bearing that relieved the sombre aspect of a room
which spoke but too plainly of narrow fortune; and as her father looked at
her, the traces of recent displeasure passed from his face, and her eyes
brightened up, while he said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You bring a blessing with the very sound of your voice, darling.&rdquo; And he
kissed her twice as he spoke.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is so comfortable to be here, and so snug,&rdquo; said she, seating herself
at his side, &ldquo;and to know that to-morrow is Sunday, and that we have our
holiday, each of us. Come, papa, confess this little room and its bright
fire are very cheery! And I have got a newspaper for you. I told Mrs.
Hawksey there was nothing such a treat to you as a newspaper, and she gave
me one.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah! the 'Trumpet of Liberty,'&rdquo; said he, opening it. &ldquo;We'll have it after
tea, Bella. Is there anything about our own county in it,&mdash;Cork, I
mean?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have not looked in it yet; but we 'll go through it honestly, papa, for
I know how conscientious you are not to lose a paragraph.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;'T is that same makes a man agreeable in society. You know everything if
you read the papers,&mdash;accidents and marriages, the rate of the
money-market, the state of the crops, who is dining with the Queen, and
who is skating on the Serpentine, who is ruined at Newmarket, and who
drowned at sea, and then all about the play-houses and the wonderful
panoramas; so that, let conversation turn how it will, you 're ready for
it, and that 's the reason, Bella, you must go through every bit of it.
It's like hunting, and the very field perhaps you don't try is just the
one you 'd find a fox in!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, you 'll see. I 'll beat every cover for you!&rdquo; said she, laughing;
&ldquo;and Mrs. Hawksey desires to have it back, for there is something about
the Alderman having said or done&mdash;I don't know what or where.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How I hate the very name of an Alderman!&rdquo; said Kellett, peevishly;
&ldquo;regular vagabonds, with gilt coaches and red cloaks, running about
prating of taxes and the pipe-water! The devil a thing I feel harder to
bear in my poverty than to think you 're a visiting governess in an
Alderman's family. Paul Kellett's daughter a visiting governess!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And very proud am I to be thought equal to the charge,&rdquo; said she,
resolutely; &ldquo;not to say how grateful to you for having enabled me to
undertake it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Myself in the Customs is nothing; that I'd put up with. Many a reduced
gentleman did the same. Sam Crozier was a marker at a billiard-table in
Tralee, and Ennis Magrath was an overseer on the very road he used to
drive his four-in-hand. 'Many a time,' says he, 'I cursed that
fresh-broken stone, but I never thought I 'd be measuring it!' 'T is the
Encumbered Court has brought us all down, Bella, and there's no disgrace
in being ruined with thousands of others. Just begin with the sales of
estates, and tell us who is next for sentence. God forgive me, but I feel
a kind of pleasure in hearing that we 're all swamped together.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The girl smiled as though the remark were merely uttered in levity and
deserved no more serious notice; but a faint sigh, which she could not
repress, betrayed the sorrow with which she had heard it.
</p>
<p>
She opened the paper and glanced at its contents. They were as varied and
multifarious as are usually to be found in weekly &ldquo;channels of
information.&rdquo; What struck her, however, most was the fact that, turn where
she would, the name of Davenport Dunn was ever conspicuous. Sales of
property displayed him as the chief creditor or petitioner; charities
paraded him as the first among the benevolent; Joint-stock companies
exhibited him as their managing director; mines, and railroads, and
telegraph companies, harbor committees, and boards of all kinds, gave him
the honors of large type; while in the fashionable intelligence from
abroad, his arrivals and departures were duly chronicled, and a letter of
our own correspondent from Venice communicated the details of a farewell
dinner given him, with a &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; in the chair, by a number of those who had
so frequently partaken of his splendid hospitalities while he resided in
that city.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;well&mdash;well!&rdquo; said Kellett, with a pause between each
exclamation, &ldquo;this is more than I can bear. Old Jerry Dunn's son,&mdash;the
brat of a boy I remember in the Charter' School! He used to be sent at
Christmas time up to Ely Place, when my father was in town, to get five
shillings for a Christmas-box; and I mind well the day he was asked to
stay and dine with my sister Matty and myself, and he taught us a new game
with six little bits of sticks; how we were to do something, I forget
what,&mdash;but I know how it ended,&mdash;he won every sixpence we had.
Matty had half a guinea in gold and some tenpenny pieces, and I had, I
think, about fifteen shillings, and sorrow a rap he left us; and, worse
still, I mortgaged my school maps, and got a severe thrashing for having
lost them from Old White in Jervas Street; and poor Matty's doll was
confiscated in the same way, and carried off with a debt of
three-and-fourpence on her head. God forgive him, but he gave us a
sorrowful night, for we cried till daybreak.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And did you like him as a playfellow?&rdquo; asked she.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now, that's the strangest thing of all,&rdquo; said Kellett, smiling. &ldquo;Neither
Matty nor myself liked him; but he got a kind of influence over us that
was downright fascination. No matter what we thought of doing before he
came, when he once set foot in the room everything followed his dictation.
It was n't that he was overbearing or tyrannical in the least; just as
little could you say that he was insinuating or nattering; but somehow, by
a kind of instinct, we fell into his ways, and worked out all his
suggestions just as if we were mere agents of his will. Resistance or
opposition we never dreamed of while he was present; but after he was gone
away, once or twice there came the thought that there was something very
like slavery in all this submission, and we began to concert how we might
throw off the yoke.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;'I won't play toll-bar any more,' said I, resolutely; 'all my
pocket-money is sure to go before it is over.'
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;'And I,' said Matty, 'won't have poor &ldquo;Mopsy&rdquo; tried for a murder again;
every time she's hanged, some of the wax comes off her neck.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We encouraged each other vigorously in these resolves; but before he was
half an hour in the house 'Mopsy' had undergone the last sentence of the
law, and I was insolvent.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What a clever rogue he must have been!&rdquo; said Bella, laughing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Was n't he clever!&rdquo; exclaimed Kellett. &ldquo;You could not say how,&mdash;nobody
could say how,&mdash;but he saw everything the moment he came into a new
place, and marked every one's face, and knew, besides, the impression he
made on them, just as if he was familiar with them for years.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Did you continue to associate with him as you grew up?&rdquo; asked she.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; we only knew each other as children. There was a distressing thing&mdash;a
very distressing thing&mdash;occurred one day; I'm sure to this very hour
I think of it with sorrow and shame, for I can't believe he had any blame
in it. We were playing in a room next my father's study, and running every
now and then into the study; and there was an old-fashioned penknife&mdash;a
family relic, with a long bloodstone handle&mdash;lying on the table; and
when the play was over, and Davy, as we called him, had gone home, this
was missing. There was a search made for it high and low, for my father
set great value on it. It was his great-great-grandmother's, I believe; at
all events, no one ever set eyes on it afterwards, and nothing would
persuade my father but that Davy stole it! Of course he never told us that
he thought so, but the servant did, and Matty and myself cried two nights
and a day over it, and got really sick.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I remember well; I was working by myself in the garden, Matty was ill and
in bed, when I saw a tall old man, dressed like a country shopkeeper,
shown into the back parlor, where my father was sitting. There was a bit
of the window open, and I could hear that high words were passing between
them, and, as I thought, my father getting the worst of it; for the old
fellow kept repeating, 'You 'll rue it, Mister Kellett,&mdash;you 'll rue
it yet!' And then my father said, 'Give him a good horsewhipping, Dunn;
take my advice, and you 'll spare yourself some sorrow, and save him from
even worse hereafter.' I 'll never forget the old fellow's face as he
turned to leave the room. 'Davy will live to pay you off for this,' said
he; 'and if <i>you 're</i> not to the fore, it will be your children, or
your children's children, will have to 'quit the debt!'
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We never saw Davy from that hour; indeed, we were strictly forbidden ever
to utter his name; and it was only when alone together, that Matty and I
would venture to talk of him, and cry over&mdash;and many a time we did&mdash;the
happy days when we had him for our playfellow. There was a species of
martyrdom now, too, in his fate, that endeared him the more to our
memories; every play he had invented, every spot he was fond of, every toy
he liked, were hallowed to our minds like relics. At last poor Matty and I
could bear it no longer, and we sat down and wrote a long letter to Davy,
assuring him of our fullest confidence in his honor, and our
broken-heartedness at separation from him. We inveighed stoutly against
parental tyranny, and declared ourselves ready for open rebellion, if he,
that was never deficient in a device, could only point out the road. We
bribed a stable-boy, with all our conjoined resources of pocket-money, to
convey the epistle, and it came back next morning to my father, enclosed
in one from Davy himself, stating that he could never countenance acts of
disobedience, or be any party to a system by which children should deceive
their parents. I was sent off to a boarding-school the same week, and poor
Matty committed to the charge of Miss Morse, a vinegar-faced old maid,
that poisoned the eight best years of her life!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And when did you next hear of him?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of Davy? Let me see; the next time I heard of him was when he attempted
to enter college as a sizar, and failed. Somebody or other mentioned it at
Kellett's Court, and said that old Dunn was half out of his mind,
insisting that some injustice was dealt out to his son, and vowing he 'd
get the member for somewhere to bring the matter before Parliament. Davy
was wiser, however; he persuaded his father that, by agitating the
question, they would only give notoriety to what, if left alone, would
speedily be forgotten; and Davy was right I don't think there's three men
now in the kingdom that remember one word about the sizarship, or, if they
do, that would be influenced by it in any dealings they might have with
Mr. Davenport Dunn.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What career did he adopt after that?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He became a tutor, I think, in Lord Glengariff's family. There was some
scandal about him there,&mdash;I forget it now,&mdash;and then he went off
to America, and spent some years there, and in Jamaica, where he was
employed as an overseer, I think; but I can't remember it all. My own
knowledge of him next was seeing the name 'D. Dunn, solicitor,' on a neat
brass-plate in Tralee, and hearing that he was a very acute fellow in
election contests, and well up to dealing with the priests.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And now he has made a large fortune?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I believe you well; he's the richest man in Ireland. There's scarce a
county he has n't got property in. There's not a town, nor a borough,
where he has n't some influence, and in every class, too,&mdash;gentry,
clergy, shopkeepers, people: he has them all with him, and nobody seems to
know how he does it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pretty much, I suppose, as he used to manage Aunt Matty and yourself long
ago,&rdquo; said she, laughingly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, indeed, I suppose so,&rdquo; said he, with a half sigh; &ldquo;and if it be,
all I can say is, they 'll be puzzled to find out his secret. He's the
deepest fellow I ever heard or read of; for there he stands to-day,
without name, family, blood, or station, higher than those that had them
all,&mdash;able to do more than them; and, what's stranger still, thought
more about in England than the best man amongst us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have given me quite an interest about him, papa; tell me, what is he
like?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He's as tall as myself, but not so strongly built; indeed, he's slightly
round-shouldered; he is dark in the complexion, and has the blackest hair
and whiskers I ever saw, and rather good-looking than otherwise,&mdash;a
calm, cold, patient-looking face you'd call it; he speaks very little, but
his voice is soft and low and deliberate, just like one that would n't
throw away a word; and he never moves his hands or arms, but lets them
hang down heavily at either side.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And his eyes? Tell me of his eyes?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They 're big, black, sleepy-looking eyes, seldom looking up, and never
growing a bit brighter by anything that he says or hears about him.
Indeed, any one seeing him for the first time would say, 'There's a man
whose thoughts are many a mile away; he is n't minding what's going on
about him here.' But that is not the case; there is n't a look, a stir,
nor a gesture that he does n't remark. There 's not a chair drawn closer
to another, not a glance interchanged, that he has n't noticed; and I 've
heard it said, 'Many would n't open a letter before him, he's so sure to
guess the contents from just reading the countenance.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The world is always prone to exaggerate such gifts,&rdquo; said she, calmly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So it may be, dear, but I don't fancy it could do so here. He's one of
those men that, if he had been born to high station, would be a great
politician or a great general. You see that, somehow, without any effort
on his part, things come up just as he wished them. I believe, after all,&rdquo;
 said he, with a heavy sigh, &ldquo;it's just luck! Whatever one man puts his
hand to in this world goes on right and smoothly, and another has every
mishap and misfortune that can befall him. He may strive, and toil, and
fret his brains over it, but devil a good it is. If he is born to ill
luck, it will stick to him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's not a very cheery philosophy!&rdquo; said she, gently.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I suppose not, dear; but what is very cheery in this life, when you come
to find it out? Is n't it nothing but disappointment and vexation?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Partly to rally him out of this vein of depression, and partly from
motives of curiosity, she once more adverted to Dunn, and asked how it
happened that they crossed each other again in life.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He's what they call 'carrying the sale' of Kellett's Court, my dear. You
know we 're in the Encumbered Estates now; and Dunn represents Lord
Lackington and others that hold the mortgages over us. The property was up
for sale in November, then in May last, and was taken down by Dunn's
order. I never knew why. It was then, however, he got me this thing in the
Revenue,&mdash;this beggarly place of sixty-five pounds a year; and told
me, through his man Hanks,&mdash;for I never met himself about it,&mdash;that
he 'd take care my interests were not overlooked. After that the Courts
closed, and he went abroad; and that's all there's between us, or, indeed,
likely to be between us; for he never wrote me as much as one line since
he went away, nor noticed any one of my letters, though I sent him four,
or, indeed, I believe, five.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What a strange man this must be!&rdquo; said she, musingly. &ldquo;Is it supposed
that he has formed any close attachments? Are his friends devoted to him?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Attachments,&mdash;friendships! faith, I'm inclined to think it's little
time he'd waste on one or the other. Why, child, if what we hear be true,
he goes through the work of ten men every day of his life.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is he married?&rdquo; asked she, after a pause.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; there was some story about a disappointment he met early in life.
When he was at Lord Glengariff's, I think, he fell in love with one of the
daughters, or she with him,&mdash;I never knew it rightly,&mdash;but it
ended in his being sent away; and they say he never got over it. Just as
if Davenport Dunn was a likely man either to fall in love or cherish the
memory of a first passion! I wish you saw him, Bella,&rdquo; said he, laughing,
&ldquo;and the notion would certainly amuse you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But still men of his stamp have felt&mdash;ay, and inspired&mdash;the
strongest passions. I remember reading once&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Reading, my darling,&mdash;reading
is one thing, seeing or knowing is another. The fellows that write these
things must invent what is n't likely,&mdash;what is nigh impossible,&mdash;or
nobody would read it What we see of a man or woman in a book is just the
exact reverse of what we 'll ever find in real life.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The girl could easily have replied to this assertion; indeed, the answer
was almost on her lips, when she restrained herself, and, hanging down her
head, fell into a musing fit.

<h2>
CHAPTER IV. ONE WHO WOULD BE A &ldquo;SHARP FELLOW.&rdquo;
 </h2>
<p>
One of the chief, perhaps the greatest, pleasures which Kellett's humble
lot still secured him, was a long country walk of a Sunday in company with
one who had been his friend in more prosperous times. A reduced gentleman
like himself, Annesley Beecher could only go abroad on this one day in the
week, and thus by the pressure of adverse fortune were they thrown more
closely together.
</p>
<p>
Although by no means a favorite with Bella, she was far too considerate
for her father, and too mindful of the few enjoyments that remained to
him, ever to interpose her real opinion. She therefore limited herself to
silence, as old Kellett would pronounce some glowing eulogy of his friend,
calling him &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;amiable&rdquo; and &ldquo;kind-hearted,&rdquo; and extolling, as
little short of miraculous, &ldquo;the spirits he had, considering all he went
through.&rdquo; But he would add, &ldquo;He was always the same, and that's the reason
everybody liked him,&mdash;everybody, that is, almost everybody!&rdquo; And he
would steal a sly glance at his daughter, half imploringly, as though to
say, &ldquo;How long are you to sit in that small minority?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Whether the weather would permit of Beecher's coming out to see them,
whether he 'd be able to &ldquo;stay and take his bit of dinner with them,&rdquo; were
subjects of as great anxiety to poor Kellett each succeeding Sunday
morning as though there ever had been a solitary exception to the
wished-for occurrence; and Bella would never destroy the pleasure of
anticipation by the slightest hint that might impair the value he attached
to the event.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There's so many trying to get him,&rdquo; he would say; &ldquo;they pester his life
out with invitations,&mdash;the Chancellor and Lord Killybegs and the
Bishop of Drumsna always asking him to name his day; but he 'd rather come
out and take his bit of roast mutton with ourselves, and his glass of
punch after it, than he 'd eat venison and drink claret with the best of
them. There's not a table in Dublin, from the Castle down, that would n't
be proud of his company; and why not?&rdquo; He would pause after uttering a
challenge of this sort; and then, as his daughter would show no signs of
acceptance, he would mutter on, &ldquo;A real gentleman born and bred, and how
anybody can <i>mislike</i> him is more than I am really able to
comprehend!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
These little grumblings, which never produced more than a smile from
Bella, were a kind of weekly homily which poor Kellett liked to deliver,
and he felt, when he had uttered it, as one who had paid a just tribute to
worth and virtue.
</p>
<p>
<a name="linkimage-0003" id="linkimage-0003">
<!-- IMG --></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
<img src="images/10066.jpg" width="100%" alt="066 " />
</div>
<p>
&ldquo;There's Beecher already, by Jove!&rdquo; cried Kellett, as he sprang up from
the breakfast-table to open the little wicket which the other was vainly
endeavoring to unhasp. &ldquo;How early he is!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Let us take the opportunity to present him to our readers,&mdash;a duty
the more imperative, since, to all outward semblance at least, he would
appear little to warrant the flattering estimate his friend so lately
bestowed upon him. About four or five-and-thirty, somewhat above the
middle size, and with all the air and bearing of a man of fashion, Beecher
had the gay, easy, light-hearted look of one with whom the world went
habitually well; and when it did not, more was the shame of the said
world! since a better, nobler, more generous fellow than himself never
existed; and this <i>he</i> knew, however others might ungraciously hold
an opposite opinion. There was not the slightest detail in his dress that
could warrant the supposition of narrow fortune: his coat and his
waistcoat, of one color and stuff, were faultless in make; the massive
watch-chain that festooned across his chest in the last mode; his thick
walking-boots the perfection of that compromise between strength and
elegance so popular in our day; even to his cane, whose head was of
massive gold, with his arms embossed,&mdash;all bespoke a certain
affluence and abundance, the more assured from the absence of ostentation.
</p>
<p>
His hat was slightly, very slightly, set on one side,&mdash;a piece of
&ldquo;tigerism&rdquo; pardonable, perhaps, as it displayed the rich brown curls of
very silky hair, which he had disposed with consummate skill before his
glass ere he issued forth. His large, full blue eyes, his handsome mouth,
and a certain gentleness in his look generally, were what he himself would
have called the &ldquo;odds in his favor;&rdquo; and very hard it would indeed have
been at first sight to form an estimate in any way unfavorable to him.
Bean Beecher, as he was called once, had been deemed the best-looking
fellow about town, and when he entered the Life Guards, almost twenty
years before the time we now present him, had been reckoned the handsomest
man and best rider in the regiment. Brother of Lord Lackington, but not by
the same mother, he had inaugurated that new school of dandyism which
succeeded to the Brummell period, and sought fame and notoriety by
splendor and extravagance rather than by the fastidious and personal
elegance that characterized the former era. In this way Lord Lackington
and his brother were constantly contrasted; and although each had their
followers, it was generally admitted that they were both regarded as
admirable types of style and fashion. Boodle's would have preferred the
Peer, the Guards' Club and all Tattersall's have voted for the Honorable
Annesley Beecher.
</p>
<p>
Beecher started in life with all the advantages and disadvantages which
attach to the position of a younger son of a noble family. On the one side
he had good connections, a sure status in society, and easy admission into
club life; on the other, lay the counterbalancing fact of the very slender
fortune which usually falls to the lot of the younger born. The sum, in
his case, barely sufficed to carry him through his minority, so that the
day he came of age he had not a shilling in the world. Most men open their
career in life with some one ambition or other in their hearts. Some
aspire to military glory and the fame of a great general, some yearn after
political eminence, and fashion to themselves the triumphs of successful
statesmanship. There are lesser goals in the walks of the learned
professions which have each their votaries; and sanguine spirits there are
who found, in imagination, distant colonies beyond the sea, or lead lives
of adventure in exploring unvisited and unknown regions. Annesley Beecher
had no sympathy with any of these. The one great and absorbing wish of his
heart was to be a &ldquo;sharp fellow;&rdquo; one who in all the dealings and traffic
of life was sure to get the upper hand of his adversary, who in every
trial where craft was the master, and in whatever situation wherein
cunning performed a part, was certain to come out with the creditable
reputation of being, &ldquo;for a gentleman, the downiest cove to be met with
anywhere.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This unhappy bent was owing to the circumstance of his being early thrown
amongst men who, having nothing but their wits to depend upon, had turned
these same wits to very discreditable purposes. He became, it is needless
to say, their easy dupe; and when utterly bereft of the small patrimony
which he once possessed, was admitted as an humble brother of the
honorable guild who had despoiled him.
</p>
<p>
Men select their walk in life either from the consciousness of certain
qualities likely to obtain success, or by some overweening admiration of
those already eminent in it. It was this latter decided Beecher's taste.
Never was there one who cherished such profound respect for a crafty
fellow, for all other intellectual superiorities he could limit his
esteem: for a rogue, his veneration was unbounded. From the man that
invented a bubble company, to him who could turn the king at <i>écarté</i>&mdash;from
the gifted individual who could puff up shares to an exorbitant value, to
the no less fine intelligence that could &ldquo;make everything safe on the
Derby,&rdquo; he venerated them all. His early experiences had been unhappy
ones, and so constantly had he found himself duped and &ldquo;done&rdquo; on every
hand, that he ended by believing that honesty was a pure myth; the nearest
approach to the quality being a certain kind of fidelity to one's &ldquo;pall,&rdquo;
 as he would have called it, and an unwillingness to put &ldquo;your own friend
in the hole,&rdquo; while there were so many others available for that pleasant
destiny. This little flickering flame of principle, this farthing candle
of good feeling, was the solitary light that illuminated the gloom of his
character.
</p>
<p>
He had joined the regiment Kellett formerly belonged to at Malta, a few
weeks before the other had sold out, and having met accidentally in
Ireland, they had renewed the acquaintance, stimulated by that strange
sympathy which attracts to each other those whose narrow circumstances
would seem, in some shape or other, the effects of a cruelty practised on
them by the world. Kellett was rather flattered by the recognition of him
who recalled the brighter hours of his life, while he entertained a kind
of admiration for the worldly wit and cleverness of one who, in talk at
least, was a match for the &ldquo;shrewdest fellow going.&rdquo; Beecher liked the
society of a man who thus looked up to him, and who could listen
unweariedly to his innumerable plans for amassing wealth and fortune, all
of which only needed some little preliminary aid&mdash;some miserable
thousand or two to start with&mdash;to make them as &ldquo;rich as Rothschild.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Never was there such a Tantalus view of life as he could picture,&mdash;stores
of gold, mines of unbounded wealth,&mdash;immense stakes to be won here,
<i>rouge et noir</i> banks to be broke there,&mdash;all actually craving
to be appropriated, if one only had a little of that shining metal which,
like the water thrown down in a pump, is the needful preliminary to
securing a supply of the fluid afterwards.
</p>
<p>
The imaginative faculty plays a great part in the existence of the reduced
gentleman! Kellett actually revelled in the gorgeous visions this friend
could conjure up. There was that amount of plausibility in his reasonings
that satisfied scruple as to practicability, and made him regard Beecher
as the most extraordinary instance of a grand financial genius lost to the
world,&mdash;a great Chancellor of the Exchequer born to devise budgets in
obscurity!
</p>
<p>
Bella took a very different measure of him: she read him with all a
woman's nicest appreciation, and knew him thoroughly; she saw, however,
how much his society pleased her father, how their Sunday strolls together
rallied him from the dreary depression the week was sure to leave behind
it, and how these harmless visions of imaginary prosperity served to cheer
the gloom of actual poverty. She, therefore, concealed so much as she
could of her own opinion, and received Beecher as cordially as she was
able.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, Paul, my boy, how goes it? Miss Kellett, how d'ye do?&rdquo; said Beecher,
with that easy air and pleasant smile that well became him. &ldquo;I thought by
starting early I should just catch you at breakfast, while I also took
another hour out of my Sunday,&mdash;the one day the law mercifully
bestows on such poor devils as myself,&mdash;ha, ha, ba!&rdquo; And he laughed
heartily, as though insolvency was as droll a thing as could be.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You bear up well, anyhow, Beecher,&rdquo; said Kellett, admiringly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What's the odds so long as you're happy!&rdquo; cried the other, gayly. &ldquo;Never
say die. They take it out in fifty per cent, but they can't work the
oracle against our good spirits, eh, Kellett? The <i>mens sana in corpore</i>,&mdash;what
d'ye call him, my lad?&mdash;that's the real thing.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed, I suppose it is!&rdquo; said Kellett, not very clear as to what he
concurred in.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There are few fellows, let me tell you, would be as light-hearted as I
am, with four writs and a judge's warrant hanging over them,&mdash;eh,
Miss Bella, what do you say to that?&rdquo; said Beecher.
</p>
<p>
She smiled half sadly and said nothing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ask John Scott,&mdash;ask Bicknell Morris, or any of the 'Legs' you like,&mdash;if
there's a man of them all ever bore up like me. 'Beecher's a bar of iron,'
they 'll tell you; 'that fellow can bear any amount of hammering.' and
maybe I have n't had it! And all Lackington's fault!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's the worst of all!&rdquo; said Kellett, who had listened to the same
accusation in the self-same words at least a hundred times before.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Lackington is the greatest fool going! He does n't see the advantage of
pushing his family influence. He might have had me in for 'Mallow.' Grog
Davis said to him one day, 'Look now, my Lord, Annesley is the best horse
in your stable, if you 'd only stand to win on him, he is!' But Lackington
would not hear of it. He thinks me a flat! You won't believe it, but he
does!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faith! he's wrong there,&rdquo; said Kellett, with all the emphasis of
sincerity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I rather suspect he is, Master Kellett. I was trained in another school,&mdash;brought
up amongst fellows would skin a cat, by Jove! What I say is, let A. B.
have a chance,&mdash;just let him in once, and see if he won't do the
thing!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you wish to be in Parliament, Mr. Beecher?&rdquo; asked Bella, with a smile
of half-repressed drollery.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course I do. First, there's the protection,&mdash;no bad thing as
times go; then it would be uncommon strange if I could n't 'tool the coach
into the yard' safely. They 'd have to give me a devilish good thing. You
'd see what a thorn I 'd be in their sides. Ask Grog Davis what kind of
fellow I am; he 'll tell you if I 'm easily put down. But Lackington is a
fool; he can't see the road before him!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You reckon, then, on being a debater!&rdquo; said she, quietly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A little of everything, Miss Bella,&rdquo; said he, laughing; &ldquo;like the modern
painters, not particular for a shade or two. I 'd not go wasting my time
with that old Tory lot,&mdash;they're all worked ont, aged and weighted,
as John Scott would call them&mdash;I'd go in with the young uns,&mdash;the
Manchester two-year-olds, universal&mdash;what d'ye call it?&mdash;and
vote by ballot. They 're the fellows have 'the tin,' by Jove! they have.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then I scarcely see how Lord Lackington would advance his family
influence by promoting your views,&rdquo; said she, again.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure he would. It would be the safest hedge in the world for him.
He 'd square his book by it, and stand to win, no matter what horse came
in. Besides, why should they buy me, if I was n't against them? You don't
nobble the horse in your own stable,&mdash;eh, Kellett, old boy?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You're a wonderful fellow, Beecher!&rdquo; said Kellett, in a most honest
admiration of his friend.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If they'd only give me a chance, Paul,&mdash;just one chance!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It was not very easy to see what blot in the game of life he purposed to
himself to &ldquo;hit&rdquo; when he used this expression, &ldquo;if they only give me a
chance;&rdquo; vague and indistinct as it was, still for many a year had it
served him as a beacon of hope. A shadow vision of creditors &ldquo;done,&rdquo;
 horses &ldquo;nobbled,&rdquo; awkward testimonies &ldquo;squared,&rdquo; a millenary period of
bills easily discounted, with an indulgent Angel presiding over the
Bankrupt Court,&mdash;these and like blessings doubtless all flitted
before him as the fruits of that same &ldquo;chance&rdquo; which destiny held yet in
store for him.
</p>
<p>
Hope is a generous fairy; she deigns to sit beside the humblest firesides,&mdash;she
will linger even in the damp cell of the prison, or rest her wings on the
wave-tossed raft of the shipwrecked, and in such mission is she thrice
blessed! But by what strange caprice does she visit the hearts of men like
this? Perhaps it is that the very spirit of her ministering is to despair
of nothing.
</p>
<p>
We are by no means sure that our reader will take the same pleasure that
Kellett did in Beecher's society, and therefore we shall spare him the
narrative of their walk. They strolled along for hours, now by the shingly
shore, on which the waves swept smoothly, now inland, through leafy lanes
and narrow roads, freckled with patchy sunlight. The day was calm and
still,&mdash;one of those solemn autumnal days which lend to scenery a
something of sadness in their unvarying quiet. Although so near a great
city, the roads were little travelled, and they sauntered for hours
scarcely meeting any one.
</p>
<p>
Wherever the smoke rose above the tall beech-trees, wherever the
ornamented porch of some lone cottage peeped through the copse, or the
handsome entrance-gate proclaimed the well-to-do owner of some luxurious
abode, Kellett would stop to tell who it was lived there,&mdash;the
wealthy merchant, the affluent banker, the alderman or city dignitary, who
had amassed his fortune by this or that pursuit. Through all his stories
there ran the vein of depreciation, which the once landed proprietor
cherished towards the men who were the &ldquo;first of their name.&rdquo; He was sure
to remember some trait of their humble beginnings in life,&mdash;how this
one had come up barefooted to Dublin fifty years before; how that had held
horses in the street for hire. It was strange, but scarcely one escaped
some commentary of this kind; not that there was a spark of ill-nature in
the man, but that he experienced a species of self-consolation in thinking
that in all his narrow fortune he had claims of kindred and connection
which none of them could compete with. Beecher's thoughts took, meanwhile,
a different course; whenever not awakened to interest by some trait of
their sharpness or cunning, to which he listened with avidity, he revelled
in the idea of their wealth, as a thing of which they might be despoiled:
&ldquo;Wouldn't that fellow take shares in some impossible speculation?&mdash;Couldn't
the other be induced to buy some thousand pounds' worth of valueless
scrip?&mdash;Would this one kindly permit himself to 'be cleared out' at
hazard?&mdash;Might that one be persuaded to lose a round sum at <i>écarté</i>?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And thus did they view life, with widely different sympathies, it is true,
but yet in a spirit that made them companionable to each other. One &ldquo;grew
his facts,&rdquo; like raw material which the other manufactured into those
curious wares by which he amused his fancy. Poverty is a stronger bond
than many believe it; when men begin to confess it to each other, they
take something very like an oath of fidelity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Beecher, as he bade his friend good night, &ldquo;you told me
you knew Dunn&mdash;Davenport Dunn?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure I do,&mdash;know him well.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Couldn't you introduce me to him? That's a fellow might be able to assist
me. I 'm certain he could give me a chance; eh, Kellett?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well; I expect him back in Ireland every day. I was asking after him no
later than yesterday; but he's still away.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;When he comes back, however, you can mention me, of course; he'll know
who I am.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'll do it with pleasure. Good-night, Beecher,&mdash;goodnight; and I
hope&rdquo;&mdash;this was soliloquy as he turned back towards the door,&mdash;&ldquo;I
hope Dunn will do more for you than he ever has for <i>me!</i> or, faith,
it's not worth while to make the acquaintance.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Bella retired to her room early, and Kellett sat moodily alone by his
fire. Like a great many other &ldquo;embarrassed gentlemen,&rdquo; he was dragging on
life amidst all the expedients of loans, bonds, and mortgages, when the
bill for sale of the encumbered estates became the law of the land. What
with the legal difficulties of dispossessing him, what with the changeful
fortunes of a good harvest, or money a little more plentiful in the
market, he might have gone on to the last in this fashion, and ended his
days where he began them, in the old house of his fathers, when suddenly
this new and unexpected stroke of legislation cut short all his resources
at once, and left him actually a beggar on the world.
</p>
<p>
The panic created at the first moment by a law that seemed little short of
confiscation, the large amount of landed property thus suddenly thrown
into the market, the prejudice against Irish investment so strongly
entertained by the moneyed classes in England, all tended vastly to
depreciate the value of those estates which came first for sale; and many
were sold at prices scarcely exceeding four or five years of their rental.
An accidental disturbance in the neighborhood, some petty outrage in the
locality, was enough to depreciate the value; and purchasers actually
fancied themselves engaged in speculations so hazardous that nothing short
of the most tempting advantages would requite them for their risk.
</p>
<p>
One of the very first estates for sale was Kellett's Court. The charges on
the property were immense, the accumulated debts of three generations of
spendthrifts; the first charge, however, was but comparatively small, and
yet even this was not covered by the proceeds of the sale. A house that
had cost nearly forty thousand pounds, standing on its own demesne,
surrounded by an estate yielding upwards of three thousand a year, was
knocked down for fifteen thousand four hundred pounds.
</p>
<p>
Kellett was advised to appeal against this sale on various grounds: he was
in possession of an offer of more than double for the same property in
times less prosperous; he could show a variety of grounds&mdash;surprise
and others&mdash;to invalidate the ruinous contract; and it was then that
he once again, after a whole life, found himself in contact with Davenport
Dunn, the attorney for many parties whose interests were compromised in
the sale. By no possible accident could the property be sold at such a
price as would leave any surplus to himself; but he hoped, indeed he was
told, that he would be favorably considered by those whose interest he was
defending; and this last throw for fortune was now the subject of his
dreary thoughts.
</p>
<p>
There was, too, another anxiety, and a nearer one, pressing on his heart.
Kellett had a son,&mdash;a fine, frank, open-hearted young fellow, who had
grown up to manhood, little dreaming that he would ever be called on to
labor for his own support. The idle lounging habits of a country life had
indisposed him to all study, so that even his effort to enter college was
met by a failure, and he was turned back on the very threshold of the
University. Jack Kellett went home, vowing he 'd nevermore trouble his
head about Homer and Lucian, and he kept his word; he took to his gun and
his pointers with renewed vigor, waiting until such time as he might
obtain his gazette to a regiment on service. His father had succeeded in
securing a promise of such an appointment, but, unhappily, the reply only
arrived on the very week that Kellett's Court was sold, and an order from
the Horse Guards to lodge the purchase-money of his commission came at the
very hour when they were irretrievably ruined.
</p>
<p>
Jack disappeared the next morning, and the day following brought a letter,
stating that he had enlisted in the &ldquo;Rifles,&rdquo; and was off to the Crimea.
Old Kellett concealed the sorrow that smote him for the loss of his boy,
by affecting indignation at being thus deserted. So artfully did he dress
up this self-deception that Bella was left in doubt as to whether or not
some terrible scene had not occurred between the father and son before he
left the house. In a tone that she never ventured to dispute, he forbade
her to allude to Jack before him; and thus did he treasure up this grief
for himself alone and his own lonely hours, cheating his sorrow by the
ingenious devices of that constraint he was thus obliged to practise on
himself. Like a vast number of men with whom the world has gone hardly, he
liked to brood over his misfortunes, and magnify them to himself. In this
way he opened a little bank of compassion that answered every draft he
drew on it. Over and over to himself&mdash;like a miser revelling over his
hoarded wealth&mdash;did he count all the hardships of his destiny. He
loved thus to hug his misery in solitude, while he whispered to his heart,
&ldquo;You are a courageous fellow, Paul Kellett; there are not many who could
carry your cheerful face, or walk with a head as high as you do to-day.
The man that owned Kellett's Court, and was one of the first in his
county, living in a poor cottage, with sixty pounds a year!&mdash;that's
the test of what stuff a man's made of. Show me another man in Ireland
could do it! Show me one that could meet the world as uncomplainingly, and
all the while never cease to be what he was born,&mdash;a gentleman.&rdquo; This
was the philosophy he practised; this the lesson he taught; this the paean
he chanted in his own heart The various extremities to which he might&mdash;being
anything other than what he was&mdash;have been tempted, the excesses he
might have fallen into, the low associates he might have kept, the base
habits he might have contracted, all the possible and impossible
contingencies that might have befallen him, and all his difficulties
therein, formed a little fiction world that he gloried to lose himself in
contemplating.
</p>
<p>
It is not often that selfishness can take a form so blameless; nor is it
always that self-deception can be so harmless. In this indulgence we now
leave him.

<h2>
CHAPTER V. THE WORLD'S CHANGES.
</h2>
<p>
While Mr. Davenport Dunn's residence was in Merrion Square, his house of
business was in Henrietta Street,&mdash;one of those roomy old mansions
which, before the days of the Union, lodged the aristocracy of Ireland,
but which have now fallen into utter neglect and decay. Far more spacious
in extent, and more ornate in decoration, than anything modern Dublin can
boast, they remain, in their massive doors of dark mahogany, their richly
stuccoed ceilings, and their handsome marble chimney-pieces, the last
witnesses of a period when Dublin was a real metropolis.
</p>
<p>
From the spacious dinner-room below to the attics above, all this vast
edifice was now converted into offices, and members of Mr. Dunn's staff
were located even in the building at the rear, where the stables once had
stood. Nothing can so briefly convey the varied occupations of his life as
a glance at some of the inscriptions which figured on the different doors:
&ldquo;Inland Navigation Office,&rdquo; &ldquo;Grand Munster Junction Drainage,&rdquo; &ldquo;Compressed
Fuel Company,&rdquo; &ldquo;Reclaimed Lands,&rdquo; &ldquo;Encumbered Estates,&rdquo; &ldquo;Coast Fishery,&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Copper and Cobalt Mining Association,&rdquo; &ldquo;Refuge Harbor Company,&rdquo; &ldquo;Slate
and Marble Quarries,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tyrawley and Erris Bank of Deposit,&rdquo; &ldquo;Silver and
Lead Mines.&rdquo; These were but a few of the innumerable &ldquo;associations,&rdquo;
 &ldquo;companies,&rdquo; and &ldquo;industrial speculations&rdquo; which denoted the cares and
employments of that busy head. Indeed, the altered fortunes of that great
mansion itself presented no bad type of the changed destinies of the land.
Here, once, was the abode of only too splendid hospitality, of all that
refined courtesy and polished manners could contribute to make society as
fascinating as it was brilliant Here were wit and beauty, and a high,
chivalrous tone of manners, blended, it is true, with wildest extravagance
and a general levity of thought, that imparted to intercourse the glowing
tints of an orgy; and in their stead were now the active signs of
industry, all the means by which wealth is amassed and great fortunes
acquired, every resource of the country explored, every natural advantage
consulted and developed,&mdash;the mountains, the valleys, the rivers, the
sea-coasts, the vast tracts of bog and moss, the various mines and
quarries, the products once deemed valueless, the districts formerly
abandoned as irreclaimable, all brought out into strong light, and all
investigated in a spirit which hitherto had been unknown to Ireland. What
a change was here, and what necessities must have been the fate of those
who had so altered all their habits and modes of thought as to conform to
a system so widely different from all they had hitherto followed! It was
like re-colonizing an empire, so subversive were all the innovations of
what had preceded them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Eh, Barton, we used to trip up these stairs more flippantly once on a
time,&rdquo; said a very handsome old man, whose well-powdered hair and queue
were rather novelties in modern appearance, to a feeble figure who,
assisted by his servant, was slowly toiling his way upwards.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How d' ye do, Glengariff?&rdquo; said the other, with a weak smile. &ldquo;So we
used; and they were better days in every sense of the word.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not a doubt of it,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Is that your destination?&rdquo; And he
pointed to a door inscribed with the title &ldquo;Encumbered Estates.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; said Barton, sighing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It 's mine, too, I 'm sorry to say,&rdquo; cried Lord Glengariff; &ldquo;as I
suppose, erelong, it will be that of every country gentleman in the land!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We might have known it must come to this!&rdquo; muttered the other, in a weak
voice.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don't think so,&rdquo; broke in his Lordship, quickly. &ldquo;I see no occasion at
all for what amounts to an act of confiscation; why not give us time to
settle with our creditors? Why not leave us to deal with our encumbrances
in our own way? The whole thing is a regular political swindle, Barton;
they wanted a new gentry that could be more easily managed than the old
fellows, who had no station, no rank, but right ready to buy both one and
the other by supporting&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Can I be of any service to your Lordship?&rdquo; interrupted a very
over-dressed and much-gold-chained man, of about forty, with a great
development of chest, set off to advantage by a very pretentious
waistcoat.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, Hankes! is Dunn come back yet?&rdquo; asked Lord Glengariff.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, my Lord; we expect him on Saturday. The telegraph is dated St. Cloud,
where he is stopping with the Emperor.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Glengariff gave Barton a slight pinch in the arm, and a look of intense
meaning at the words.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nothing has been done in that matter of mine?&rdquo; said Barton, feebly.
&ldquo;Jonas Barton is the name,&rdquo; added he, coloring at the necessity of
announcing himself.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Jonas Barton, of Curryglass House?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that's it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sold yesterday, under the Court, sir&mdash;for, let me see&mdash;&rdquo; And he
opened a small memorandum-book. &ldquo;Griffith's valuation,&rdquo; muttered he
between his teeth, &ldquo;was rather better than the Commissioner's,&mdash;yes,
sir, they got a bargain of that property yesterday; it went for twenty-two
thousand six hundred&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Great God, sir; the whole estate?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The whole estate; there is a tithe-rent charge&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There, there, don't you see he does not hear you?&rdquo; said Lord Glengariff,
angrily. &ldquo;Have you no room where he can sit down for half an hour or so?&rdquo;
 And so saying, he assisted the servant to carry the now lifeless form into
a small chamber beside them. The sick man rallied soon, and as quickly
remembered where he was.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;This is bad news, Glengariff,&rdquo; said he, with a sickly effort at a smile.
&ldquo;Have you heard who was the buyer?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no; what does it matter? Take my arm and get out of this place. Where
are you stopping in town? Can I set you down?&rdquo; said the other, in hurry
and confusion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm with my son-in-law at Ely Place; he is to call for me here, so you
can leave me, my dear friend, for I see you are impatient to get away.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Lord Glengariff pressed his hand cordially, and descended the stairs far
more rapidly than he had mounted them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Lord Glengariff,&mdash;one word, my Lord,&rdquo; cried Mr. Hankes, hastening
after him, and just catching him at the door.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not now, sir,&mdash;not now,&rdquo; said Lord Glengariff.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I beg a thousand pardons, my Lord, but Mr. Dunn writes me peremptorily to
say that it cannot be effected&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not raise the money, did you say?&rdquo; asked he, growing suddenly pale.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not in the manner he proposed, my Lord. If you will allow me to explain&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come over to my hotel. I am at Bilton's,&rdquo; said Lord Glengariff. &ldquo;Call on
me there in an hour.&rdquo; And so saying, he got into his carriage and drove
off.
</p>
<p>
In the large drawing-room of the hotel sat a lady working, and
occasionally reading a book which lay open before her. She was tall and
thin, finely featured, and though now entered upon that period of life
when every line and every tint confess the ravage of time, was still
handsome. This was Lady Augusta Arden, Lord Glengariff's only unmarried
daughter, the very type of her father in temperament as well as
appearance.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;By George! it is confiscation. It is the inauguration of that Communism
the French speak of,&rdquo; cried Lord Glengariff, as he entered the room.
&ldquo;There 's poor Barton of Curryglass, one of the oldest names in his
county, sold out, and for nothing,&mdash;absolutely nothing. No man shall
persuade me that this is just or equitable; no man shall tell me that the
Legislature shall step in and decide at any moment how I am to deal with
my creditors.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I never heard of that Burton.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I said Barton,&mdash;not Burton; a man whose estate used to be called
five thousand a year,&rdquo; said he, angrily. &ldquo;There he is now, turned out on
the world. I verily believe he has n't a guinea left! And what is all this
for? To raise up in the country a set of spurious gentry,&mdash;fellows
that were never heard of, whose names are only known over shop-boards,&mdash;as
if the people should be better treated or more kindly dealt with by them
than by us, their natural protectors! By George! if Ireland should swarm
with Davenport Dunns, I 'd call it a sorry exchange for the good blood she
had lost in exterminating her old gentry.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Has he come back?&rdquo; asked Lady Augusta, as she bent her head more deeply
over her work, and her cheeks grew a shade more red.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; he's dining with royalties, and driving about in princely carriages
on the Continent Seeing what the pleasures of his intimacy have cost us
here at home, I'd say that these great personages ought to look sharp, or,
by George! he'll sell them out, as he has done us.&rdquo; He laughed a bitter
laugh at his jest, but his daughter did not join in the emotion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I scarcely think it fair,&rdquo; said she, at length, &ldquo;to connect Mr. Dunn with
a legislation which he is only called upon to execute.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;With all my heart. Acquit him as much as you will; but, for my part, I
feel very little tenderness for the hand that accomplishes the last
functions of the law against me. These fellows have displayed a zeal and
an alacrity in their work that shows how they relish the sport. After
all,&rdquo; said he, after a pause, &ldquo;this Dunn is neither better nor worse than
the rest of them, and in one respect he has the advantage over them,&mdash;he
has not forgotten himself quite so much as the others. To be sure, we knew
him in his very humblest fortunes, Augusta; he was meek enough then.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She stooped to pick up her work, which had fallen, and her neck and face
were crimson as she resumed it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Wonderful little anticipation had he then of the man he was to become one
of these days. Do you know, Augusta, that they say he is actually worth
two millions?&mdash;two millions!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She never spoke; and after an interval Lord Glengariff burst out into a
strange laugh.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You 'd scarcely guess what I was laughing at, Augusta. I was just
remembering the wretched hole he used to sleep in. It was a downright
shame to put him there over the stable, but the cottage was under repair
at the time, and there was no help for it. 'I can accommodate myself
anywhere, my Lord,' he said. Egad, he has contrived to fulfil the
prediction in a very different sense. Just fancy&mdash;two millions
sterling!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It was precisely what Lady Augusta was doing at the moment, though,
perhaps, not quite in the spirit his Lordship suspected.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Suppose even one half of it be true, with a million of money at command,
what can't a man have nowadays?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And so they both fell a-thinking of all that same great amount of riches
could buy,&mdash;what of power, respect, rank, flattery, political
influence, fine acquaintance, fine diamonds, and fine dinners.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If he play his cards well, he might be a peer,&rdquo; thought my Lord.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If he be as ambitious as he ought to be, he might aspire to a peer's
daughter,&rdquo; was the lady's reflection.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He has failed in my negotiation, however,&rdquo; said Lord Glengariff,
peevishly; &ldquo;at least, Hankes just told me that it can't be done. I detest
that fellow Hankes. It shows great want of tact in Dunn having such a man
in his employment,&mdash;a vulgar, self-sufficient, over-dressed fellow,
who can't help being familiar out of his own self-satisfaction. Now, Dunn
himself knows his place. Don't you think so?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She muttered something not very intelligible, but which sounded like
concurrence.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;Dunn does not forget himself,&mdash;at least, with
me.&rdquo; And to judge from the carriage of his head as he spoke, and the air
with which he earned the pinch of snuff to his nose, he had not yet
despaired of seeing the world come back to the traditions which once had
made it worth living in.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am willing to give him every credit for his propriety of conduct,
Augusta,&rdquo; added he, in a still more lofty tone; &ldquo;for we live in times when
really wealth and worldly prosperity have more than their rightful
supremacy, and such men as Dunn are made the marks of an adulation that is
actually an outrage,&mdash;an outrage upon <i>us!</i>&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And the last little monosyllable was uttered with an emphasis of intense
significance.
</p>
<p>
Just as his Lordship had rounded his peroration, the servant presented him
with a small three-cornered note. He opened it and read,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My Lord,&mdash;I think the bearer of this, T. Driscoll, might possibly do
what you wish for; and I send him, since I am sure that a personal
interview with your Lordship would be more efficacious than any
negotiation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;By your Lordship's most obedient to command,
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Simpson Hankes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is the person who brought this below?&rdquo; asked Lord Glengariff.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my Lord; he is waiting for the answer.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Show him into my dressing-room.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mr. Terence Driscoll was accordingly introduced into that sanctum; and
while he employs his few spare moments in curious and critical examination
of the various gold and silver objects which contribute to his Lordship's
toilet, and wonderingly snuffs at essences and odors of whose existence he
had never dreamed, let us take the opportunity of a little examination of
himself. He was a short, fat old man, with a very round red face, whose
jovial expression was rather heightened than marred by a tremendous
squint; for the eyes kept in incessant play and movement, which intimated
a restless drollery that his full, capacious mouth well responded to. In
dress and general appearance he belonged to the class of the comfortable
farmer, and his massive silver watch-chain and huge seal displayed a
consciousness of his well-to-do condition in life.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you Mr. Driscoll?&rdquo; said Lord Glengariff, as he looked at the letter
to prompt him to the name. &ldquo;Pray take a seat!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my Lord, I 'm that poor creature Terry Driscoll; the neighbors call
me Tearin' Terry, but that 's all past and gone, Heaven be praised! It was
a fever I had, my Lord, and my rayson wandered, and I did many a thing
that desthroyed me entirely; I tore up the lease of my house, I tore up
Peter Driscoll's, my uncle's, will; ay, and worse than all, I tore up all
my front teeth!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And, in evidence of this feat of dentistry, Mr. Driscoll gave a grin that
exposed his bare gums to view.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good heavens, how shocking!&rdquo; exclaimed Lord Glen-gariff, though, not
impossibly, the expression was extorted by the sight rather than the
history of the calamity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Shocking indeed, my Lord,&mdash;that's the name for it!&rdquo; said Terry,
sighing; &ldquo;but ye see I was n't compos when I did it. I thought they were a
set of blackguards that I could n't root out of the land,&mdash;squatters
that would n't pay sixpence, nor do a day's work. That was the delusion
that was upon me!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I hold here a letter from Mr. Hankes,&rdquo; said his Lordship, pompously, and
in a tone that was meant to recall Mr. Driscoll from the personal
narrative he had entered upon with such evident self-satisfaction. &ldquo;He
mentions you as one likely&mdash;that is to say&mdash;one in a position&mdash;a
person, in fact&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my Lord, yes,&rdquo; interrupted Terry, with a grin of unbounded
acquiescence.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And adds,&rdquo; continued his Lordship, &ldquo;your desire to communicate personally
with myself.&rdquo; The words were very few and not very remarkable, and yet
Lord Glengariff contrived to throw into them an amount of significance
really great. They seemed to say, &ldquo;Bethink thee well, Terry Driscoll, of
the good fortune that this day has befallen thee. Thy boldness has been
crowned with success, and there thou sittest now, being the poor worm that
thou art, in converse with one who wears a coronet.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And so, indeed, in all abject humility, did Mr. Driscoll appear to feel
the situation. He drew his feet closer together, and stole his hands up
the wide sleeves of his coat, as though endeavoring to diminish, as far as
might be, his corporeal presence.
</p>
<p>
His Lordship saw that enough had been done for subjection, and blandly
added, &ldquo;And I could have no objection to the interview; none whatever.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's too good you are, my Lord; too good and too gracious to the like of
me,&rdquo; said Terry, barely raising his eyes to throw a glance of mingled
shame and drollery on his Lordship; &ldquo;but I come by rayson of what Mr.
Hankes tould me, that it was a trifle of a loan,&mdash;a small matter of
money your Lordship was wantin' just at this moment.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I prefer doing these kind of things through my solicitors. I know nothing
of business, sir, absolutely nothing,&rdquo; said his Lordship, haughtily. &ldquo;The
present case, however, might form an exception. The sum I require is, as
you justly remark, a mere trifle, and the occasion is not worthy of legal
interference.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my Lord,&rdquo; chimed in Driscoll, who had a most provoking habit of
employing the affirmative in all situations.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I suppose he mentioned to you the amount?&rdquo; asked his Lordship, quickly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, indeed, my Lord; all he said was, 'Terry,' says he, 'go over to
Bilton's Hotel with this note, and ask for Lord Glengariff. He wants a
little ready cash,' says he, 'and I tould him you 're a likely man to get
it for him. It's too small a matter for us here,' says he, 'to be bothered
about.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He had n't the insolence to make use of these words towards <i>me!</i>&rdquo;
 said Lord Glengariff, growing almost purple with passion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faix, I 'm afeard he had, my Lord,&rdquo; said Terry, looking down; &ldquo;but I 'm
sure he never meant any harm in it; 't was only as much as to say, 'There,
Terry, there 's something for <i>you</i>; you 're a poor strugglin' man,
and are well plazed to turn a penny in a small way. If you can accommodate
my Lord there,' says he, 'he 'll not forget it to you.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The conclusion of this speech was far more satisfactory to his Lordship
than its commencement seemed to promise; and Lord Glengariff smiled half
graciously as he said, &ldquo;I 'm not in the habit of neglecting those who
serve me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my Lord,&rdquo; said Driscoll, again.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I may safely say that any influence I possess has always been exercised
in favor of those who have been, so to say, supporters of my family.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Had his Lordship uttered a sentiment of the most exalted and self-denying
import, he could not have assumed a prouder air than when he had finished
these words. &ldquo;And now, Mr. Driscoll, to business. I want five thousand
pounds&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A long, low whistle from Terry, as he threw up both his hands in the air,
abruptly stopped his Lordship.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean? Does the sum appear so tremendous, sir?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Five thousand! Where would I get it? Five thousand pounds? By the mortial
man! your Lordship might as well ax me for five millions. I thought it was
a hundred; or, maybe, a hundred and fifty; or, at the outside, two hundred
pounds, just to take you over to London for what they call the sayson, or
to cut a figure at Paris; but, five thousand! By my conscience, that's the
price of an estate nowadays!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is upon estated property I intend to raise this loan, sir,&rdquo; said his
Lordship, angrily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not Cushnacreena, my Lord?&rdquo; asked Terry, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, sir; that is secured by settlement.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nor Ballyrennin?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; the townland of Ballyrennin is, in a manner, tied up.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Tory's Mill, maybe?&rdquo; inquired Terry, with more eagerness.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said his Lordship, drawing himself up, &ldquo;I must really make
you my compliments upon the very accurate knowledge you appear to possess
about my estate. Since what period, may I venture to ask, have you
conceived this warm interest in my behalf?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The way of it was this, my Lord,&rdquo; said Driscoll, drawing his chair
closer, and dropping his voice to a low, confidential tone. &ldquo;After I had
the fever,&mdash;the fever and ague I told you about,&mdash;I got up out
of bed the poor crayture you see me, not able to think of anything, or do
a hand's turn for myself, but just a burden on my friends or anybody that
would keep me. Well, I tried all manner of ways to make myself useful, and
I used to go errands here and there over the country for any one that
wanted to know what land was to be sold, where there was a lot of good
sheep, who had a drove of bullocks or a fancy bull; and, just getting into
the habit of it, I larned a trifle of what was doing in the three
counties, so that the people call me 'Terry's Almanack,'&mdash;that's the
name they gave me, better than Tearin' Terry, anyhow! At all events, I got
a taste for finding out the secrets of all the great families; and, to be
sure, if I only had the memory, I'd know a great deal, but my head is like
a cullender, and everything runs out as fast as you put it in. That's how
it is, my Lord, and no lie in it.&rdquo; And Terry wiped his forehead and heaved
a heavy sigh, like a man who had just accomplished a very arduous task.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So, then, I begin to understand how Hankes sent you over here to me,&rdquo;
 said his Lordship.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my Lord,&rdquo; muttered Terry, with a bow.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I had been under the impression&mdash;the erroneous impression&mdash;that
you were yourself prepared to advance this small sum.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Me! Terry Driscoll lend five thousand pounds! Arrah, look at me, my Lord,&mdash;just
take a glance at me, and you 'll see how likely it is I 'd have as many
shillings! 'T was only by rayson of being always about&mdash;on the tramp,
as they call it&mdash;that Mr. Hankes thought I could be of use to your
Lordship. 'Go over,' says he, 'and just tell him who and what you are.'
There it is now!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Lord Glengariff made no reply, but slowly walked the room in deep
meditation; a passing feeling of pity for the poor fellow before him had
overcome any irritation his own disappointment had occasioned, and for the
moment the bent of his mind was compassionate.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, Driscoll,&rdquo; said he, at length, &ldquo;I don't exactly see how you can
serve me in this matter.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my Lord,&rdquo; said Terry, with a pleasant leer of his restless eyes.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I say I don't perceive that you can contribute in any way to the object I
have in view,&rdquo; said his Lordship, half peevish at being, as he thought,
misapprehended. &ldquo;Hankes ought to have known as much himself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my Lord,&rdquo; chimed in Terry.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you may tell him so from <i>me</i>. He is totally unfitted for his
situation, and I am only surprised that Dunn, shrewd fellow that he is,
should have ever placed a man of this stamp in a position of such trust.
The first requisite in such a man is to understand the deference he owes
to <i>us</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
There was an emphasis on the last monosyllable that pretty clearly
announced how little share Terry Driscoll enjoyed in this co-partnery.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That because I have a momentary occasion for a small sum of ready money,
he should send over to confer with me a half-witted&mdash;I mean a man
only half recovered from a fever&mdash;a poor fellow still suffering from&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my Lord,&rdquo; interposed Terry, as he laid his hand on his forehead in
token of the seat of his calamity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is too gross,&mdash;it is outrageous,&mdash;but Dunn shall hear of it,&mdash;Dunn
shall deal with this fellow when he comes back. I 'm sorry for you,
Driscoll,&mdash;very sorry indeed; it is a sad bereavement, and though you
are not exactly a case for an asylum,&mdash;perhaps, indeed, you might
have objections to an asylum&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my Lord.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, in that case private friends are, I opine&mdash;private friends&mdash;and
the kind sympathies of those who have known you&mdash;eh, don't you think
so?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my Lord.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That is the sensible view to take of it. I am glad you see it in this
way. It shows that you really exercise a correct judgment,&mdash;a very
wise discretion in your case,&mdash;and for a man in <i>your</i> situation&mdash;your
<i>painful</i> situation&mdash;you see things in their true light.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my Lord.&rdquo; And this time the eyes rolled with a most peculiar
expression.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If you should relapse, however,&mdash;if, say, former symptoms were to
threaten again,&mdash;remember that I am on the committee, or a governor,
or something or other, of one of these institutions, and I might be of use
to you. Remember that, Driscoll.&rdquo; And with a wave of his hand his Lordship
dismissed Terry, who, after a series of respectful obeisances, gained the
door and disappeared.

<h2>
CHAPTER VI. SYBELLA KELLETT.
</h2>
<p>
When change of fortune had reduced the Kelletts so low that Sybella was
driven to become a daily governess, her hard fate had exacted from her
about the very heaviest of all sacrifices. It was not, indeed, the life of
unceasing toil,&mdash;dreary and monotonous as such toil is,&mdash;it was
not the humility of a station for which the world affords not one solitary
protection,&mdash;these were not what she dreaded; as little was it the
jarring sense of dependence daily and hourly imposed. No, she had courage
and a high determination to confront each and all of these. The great
source of her suffering was in the loss of that calm and unbroken quiet to
which the retired habits of a remote country-house had so long accustomed
her. With scarcely anything which could be called a society near them, so
reduced in means as to be unable to receive visitors at home, Kellett's
Court had been for many years a lonely house. The days succeeded each
other with such similarity that time was unfelt, seasons came and went,
and years rolled on unconsciously. No sights nor sounds of the great world
without invaded these retired precincts. Of the mighty events which
convulsed the politics of states,&mdash;of the great issues that engaged
men's minds throughout Europe,&mdash;they heard absolutely nothing. The
passing story of some little incident of cottier life represented to them
all that they had of news; and thus time glided noiselessly along, till
they came to feel a sense of happiness in that same unbroken round of
life.
</p>
<p>
They who have experienced the measured tread of a conventual existence&mdash;where
the same incidents daily recur at the same periods, where no events from
without obtrude, where the passions and the ambitions and cares of mankind
have so little of reality to the mind that they fail to impress with any
meaning&mdash;are well aware that in the peaceful calm of spirit thus
acquired there is a sense of happiness, which is not the less real that it
wears the semblance of seriousness, almost of sadness.
</p>
<p>
In all that pertained to a sombre monotony, Kellett's Court was a convent.
The tall mountains to the back, the deep woods to the front, seemed
barriers against the world without; and there was a silence and a
stillness about the spot as though it were some lone island in a vast sea,
where no voyagers ever touched, no traveller ever landed. This same
isolation, strong in its own sense of security, was the charm of the
place, investing it with a kind of romance, and imparting to Sybella's own
life a something of storied interest. The very few books the house
contained she had read and re-read till she knew them almost by heart.
They were lives of voyagers,&mdash;hardy men of enterprise and daring, who
had pushed their fortunes in far-away lands,&mdash;or else sketches of
life and adventure in distant countries.
</p>
<p>
The annals of these sea-rovers were full of all the fascination of which
gorgeous scenery and stirring incident form the charm. There were lands
such as no painter's genius ever fancied, verdure and flowers of more than
fairy brilliancy, gold and gems of splendor that rivalled Aladdin's cave,
strange customs, and curious observances mingled with deeds of wildest
daring, making up a succession of pictures wherein the mind alternated
between the voluptuous repose of tropical enjoyment and the hair-breadth
'scapes of buccaneering existence. The great men whose genius planned, and
whose courage achieved, these enterprises, formed for her a sort of
hero-worship. Their rough virtues, their splendid hospitality, their
lion-hearted defiance of danger, were strong appeals to her sympathy,
while in their devoted loyalty she found a species of chivalry that
elevated them in her esteem. Woman-like, too, she inclined to make success
the true test of greatness, and glorified to herself those bold spirits
who never halted nor turned aside when on their road to victory. The
splendid self-dependence of such men as Drake and Dampier struck her as
the noblest attribute of mankind; that resolute trust in their own stout
hearts imparted to them a degree of interest almost devotional; and over
and over did she bethink her what a glorious destiny it would have been to
have had a life associated and bound up with some such man as one of
these. The very contest and controversy his actions would have evoked,
heightened the illusion, and there savored of heroism in sharing a fame
that flung down its proud defiance to the world.
</p>
<p>
Estrangement from the world often imparts to the stories of the past, or
even to the characters of fiction, a degree of interest which, by those
engaged in the actual work of life, is only accorded to their friends or
relatives; and thus, to this young girl in her isolation, such names as
Raleigh and Cavendish&mdash;such characters as Cromwell, Lorenzo de'
Medici, and Napoleon&mdash;stood forth before her in all the attributes of
well-known individuals. To have so far soared above the ordinary accidents
of life as to live in an atmosphere above all other men,&mdash;to have
seen the world and its ways from an eminence that gave wider scope to
vision and more play to speculation,&mdash;to have meditated over the
destinies of mankind from the height of a station that gave control over
their actions,&mdash;seemed so glorious a privilege that the blemishes and
even the crimes of men so gifted were merged in the greatness of the
mighty task they had imposed upon themselves; and thus was it that she
claimed for these an exemption from the judgments that had visited less
distinguished wrong-doers most heavily. &ldquo;How can I, or such as I am,
pronounce upon one like this man? What knowledge have I of the conflict
waged within his deep intelligence? How can I fathom the ocean of his
thoughts, or even guess at the difficulties that have opposed, the doubts
that have beset him? I can but vaguely fashion to myself the end and
object of his journey; how, then, shall I criticise the road by which he
travels, the halts he makes, the devious turnings and windings he seems to
fall into?&rdquo; In such plausibilities she merged every scruple as to those
she had deified to her own mind. &ldquo;Their ways are not our ways,&rdquo; said she;
&ldquo;their natures are as little our natures.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
From all the dreamland of these speculations was she suddenly and rudely
brought to face the battle of life itself, an humble soldier in the ranks.
No longer to dwell in secret converse with the mighty spirits who had
swayed their fellow-men, she was now to enter upon that path of daily
drudgery whose direst infliction was the contact with that work-o'-day
world wherewith she had few sympathies.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Hawkshaw had read her advertisement in a morning paper, and sent for
her to call upon her. Now Mrs. Hawkshaw was an alderman's lady, who lived
in a fine house, and had fine clothes and fine servants and fine plate,
and everything, in short, fine about her but a fine husband, for he was a
rough, homespun, good-natured sort of man, who cared little for anything
save a stocking-factory he owned at Balbriggan, and the stormy incidents
that usually shook the &ldquo;livery&rdquo; he belonged to.
</p>
<p>
There were six little Hawkshaws to be governed and geographied and
catechised, and civilized in all the various forms by which untaught
humanity is prepared for the future work of life; there were rudiments of
variously colored knowledge to be imparted, habits instilled, and tempers
controlled, by one who, though she brought to her task the most sincere
desire to succeed, was yet deep in a world of her own thoughts,&mdash;far
lost in the mazy intricacies of her own fancies. That poor Miss Kellett,
therefore, should pass for a very simple-minded, good creature, quite
unfit for her occupation, was natural enough; and that Mrs. Hawkshaw
should &ldquo;take her into training&rdquo; was almost an equally natural consequence.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;She seems to be always like one in a dream, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hawkshaw
to her husband. &ldquo;The children do exactly as they please; they play all
false, and she never corrects them; they draw landscapes in their
copy-books, and she says, 'Very nicely done, darlings.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Her misfortunes are preying upon her, perhaps.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Misfortunes! why, they have been in poverty this many a year. My brother
Terry tells me that the Kelletts had n't above two hundred a year, and
that latterly they lost even this.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, it is a come-down in the world, anyhow,&rdquo; said Hawkshaw, sighing,
&ldquo;and I must say she bears it well.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If she only feels it as little as she appears to do everything else, the
sacrifice doesn't cost her much,&rdquo; said the lady, tartly. &ldquo;I told her she
was to come here last Sunday and take charge of the children; she never
came; and when I questioned her as to the reason, she only smiled and
said, 'She never thought of it; in fact, she was too happy to be alone on
that day to think of anything.' And here she comes now, nearly an hour
late.&rdquo; And, as she spoke, a weary step ascended the steps to the door, and
an uncertain, faltering hand raised the knocker.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is nigh eleven o'clock, Miss Kellett,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hawkshaw, as she met
her on the stairs.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed&mdash;I am so sorry&mdash;I must have forgotten&mdash;I don't
think I knew the hour,&rdquo; said the other, stammeringly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your hour is ten, Miss Kellett.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How is your father, Miss Kellett?&rdquo; asked the alderman, abruptly, and not
sorry to interpose at the juncture.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He is well, sir, and seems very happy,&rdquo; said she, gratefully, while her
eyes lighted up with pleasure.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Give him my regards,&rdquo; said Hawkshaw, good-naturedly, and passed down the
stairs; while his wife coldly added,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The children are waiting for you,&rdquo; and disappeared.
</p>
<p>
With what determined energy did she address herself now to her task,&mdash;how
resolutely devote her whole mind to her duty. She read and heard and
corrected and amended with all the intense anxiety of one eager to
discharge her trust honestly and well. She did her very utmost to bring
her faculties to bear upon every detail of her task; and it was only when
one of the girls asked who was he whose name she had been writing over and
over again in her copy-book, that she forgot her self-imposed restraint,
and in a fervor of delight at the question, replied, &ldquo;I 'll tell you,
Mary, who Savonarola was.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
In all the vigor of true narrative power, the especial gift of those minds
where the play of fancy is only the adornment of the reasoning faculty,
she gave a rapid sketch of the prophet priest, his zeal, his courage, and
his martyrdom; with that captivating fascination which is the firstborn of
true enthusiasm, she awakened their interest so deeply that they listened
to all she said as to a romance whose hero had won their sympathies, and
even dimly followed her as she told them that such men as this stood out
from time to time in the world's history like great beacons blazing on a
rocky eminence, to guide and warn their fellow-men. That in their own age
characters of this stamp were either undervalued or actually depreciated
and condemned, was but the common lot of humanity; their own great
destinies raised them very often above the sympathies of ordinary life,
and men caught eagerly at the blemishes of those so vastly greater than
themselves,&mdash;hence all the disesteem they met with from
contemporaries.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And are there none like this now, Miss Bella?&rdquo; asked one of the girls;
&ldquo;or is it that in our country such are not to be met with?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They are of every land and of every age; ay, and of every station!
Country, time, birth have no prerogative. At one moment the great light of
the earth has been the noblest born in his nation, at another a peasant,&mdash;miles
apart in all the accidents of fortune, brothers by the stamp which makes
genius a tie of family. To-morrow you shall hear of one, the
noblest-hearted man in all England, and yet whose daily toil was the
vulgar life of an exciseman. This great man's nature is known to us,
teaching men a higher lesson than all that his genius has bequeathed us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
In the willingness with which they listened to her, Bella found fresh
support for her enthusiasm. If, therefore, there was this solace to the
irksome nature of her task, it rendered that task itself more and more
wearisome and distasteful. Her round of duty led her amongst many who did
not care for these things; some heard them with apathy, others with even
mockery. How often does it happen in life that feelings which if freely
expanded had spread themselves broadly over the objects of the world,
become by repression compressed into principles!
</p>
<p>
This was the case with her; the more opposition thwarted, the more
resolutely was she bent on carrying out her notions. All her reading
tended to this direction, all her speculation, all her thought.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There must be men amongst us even now,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to whom this great
prerogative of guidance is given; superior minds who feel the greatness of
their mission, and, perhaps, know how necessary it is to veil their very
ascendancy, that they may exercise it more safely and more widely. What
concession may they not be making to vulgar prejudice, what submission to
this or that ordinance of society? How many a devious path must they tread
to reach that goal that the world will not let them strive for more
directly; and, worse than all, through what a sea of misrepresentation,
and even calumny, must they wade? How must they endure the odious
imputations of selfishness, of pride, of hard-heartedness, nay, perhaps,
of even crime? And all this without the recognition of as much as one who
knows their purpose and acknowledges their desert.&rdquo;

<h2>
CHAPTER VII. AN ARRIVAL AT MIDNIGHT.
</h2>
<p>
Night had just closed in over the Lake of Como; and if the character of
the scene in daylight had been such as to suggest ideas of dramatic
effect, still more was this the case as darkness wrapped the whole
landscape, leaving the great Alps barely traceable against the starry sky,
while faintly glimmering lights dotted the dark shores from villa and
palace, and soft sounds of music floated lazily on the night air, only
broken by the plashing stroke of some gondolier as he stole across the
lake.
</p>
<p>
The Villa d'Este was a-glitter with light. The great saloon which opened
on the water blazed with lamps; the terraces were illuminated with
many-colored lanterns; solitary candles glimmered from the windows of many
a lonely chamber; and even through the dark copses and leafy parterres
some lamp twinkled, to show the path to those who preferred the scented
night air to the crowded and brilliant assemblage within doors. The
votaries of hydropathy are rarely victims of grave malady. They are
generally either the exhausted sons and daughters of fashionable
dissipation, the worn-out denizens of great cities, or the tired slaves of
exciting professions,&mdash;the men of politics, of literature, or of law.
To such as these, a life of easy indolence, the absence of all constraint,
the freedom which comes of mixing with a society where not one face is
known to them, are the chief charms; and, with that, the privilege of
condescending to amusements and intimacies of which, in their more regular
course of life, they had not even stooped to partake. To English people
this latter element was no inconsiderable feature of pleasure. Strictly
defined as all the ranks of society are in their own country,&mdash;marshalled
in classes so rigidly that none may move out of the place to which birth
has assigned him,&mdash;they feel a certain expansion in this novel
liberty, perhaps the one sole new sensation of which their natures are
susceptible. It was in the enjoyment of this freedom that a considerable
party were now assembled in the great saloons of the villa. There were
Russians and Austrians of high rank, conspicuous for their quiet and
stately courtesy; a noisy Frenchman or two; a few pale, thoughtful-looking
Italians, men whose noble foreheads seem to promise so much, but whose
actual lives appear to evidence so little; a crowd of Americans, as
distinctive and as marked as though theirs had been a nationality stamped
with centuries of transmission; and, lastly, there were the English,
already presented to our reader in an early chapter,&mdash;Lady Lackington
and her friend Lady Grace,&mdash;having, in a caprice of a moment,
descended to see &ldquo;what the whole thing was like.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>

<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
<img src="images/10098.jpg" width="100%" alt="98 " />
</div>
<p>
&ldquo;No presentations, my Lord, none whatever,&rdquo; said Lady Lackington, as she
arranged the folds of her dress, on assuming a very distinguished position
in the room. &ldquo;We have only come for a few minutes, and don't mean to make
acquaintances.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who is the little pale woman with the turquoise ornaments?&rdquo; asked Lady
Grace.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Princess Labanoff,&rdquo; said his Lordship, blandly bowing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not she who was suspected of having poisoned&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The same.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I should like to know her. And the man,&mdash;who is that tall, dark man,
with the high forehead?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Glumthal, the great Frankfort millionnaire.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, present him, by all means. Let us have him here,&rdquo; said Lady
Lackington, eagerly. &ldquo;What does that little man mean by smirking in that
fashion,&mdash;who is he?&rdquo; asked she, as Mr. O'Reilly passed and repassed
before her, making some horrible grimaces that he intended to have
represented as fascinations.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;On no account, my Lord,&rdquo; said Lady Lackington, as though replying to a
look of entreaty from his Lordship.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But you 'd really be amused,&rdquo; said he, smiling. &ldquo;It is about the best bit
of low comedy&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I detest low comedy.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The father of your fair friends, is it not?&rdquo; asked Lady Grace, languidly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes. Twining admires them vastly,&rdquo; said his Lordship, half maliciously.
&ldquo;If I might venture&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh dear, no; not to me,&rdquo; said Lady Grace, shuddering. &ldquo;I have little
tolerance for what are called characters. You may present your Hebrew
friend, if you like.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He's going to dance with the Princess; and there goes Twining, with one
of my beauties, I declare,&rdquo; said Lord Lackington. &ldquo;I say, Spicer, what is
that dark lot, near the door?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;American trotters, my Lord; just come over.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You know them, don't you?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I met them yesterday at dinner, and shall be delighted to introduce your
Lordship. Indeed, they asked me if you were not the Lord that was so
intimate with the Prince of Wales.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How stupid! They might have known, even without the aid of a Peerage,
that I was a schoolboy when the Prince was a grown man. The tall girl is
good-looking; what's her name?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She's the daughter of the Honorable Leonidas Shinbone, that's all I know,&mdash;rather
a belle at Saratoga, I fancy.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very dreadful!&rdquo; sighed Lady Grace, fanning herself; &ldquo;they do make such a
mess of what might be very pretty toilette. You could n't tell her,
perhaps, that her front hair is dressed for the back of the head.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, sir; I never play at cards,&rdquo; said Lord Lackington, stiffly, as an
American gentleman offered him a pack to draw from.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Only a little bluff or a small party of poker,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;for
quarter dollars, or milder, if you like it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A cold bow of refusal was the reply.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I told you he was the Lord,&rdquo; said a friend, in a drawling accent &ldquo;He
looks as if he 'd 'mow us all down like grass.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Dr. Lanfranchi, the director of the establishment, here interposed, and,
by a few words, induced the Americans to retire and leave the others
unmolested.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thank you, doctor,&rdquo; said Lady Lackington, in acknowledgment; &ldquo;your tact
is always considerate,&mdash;always prompt.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;These things never happen in the season, my Lady,&rdquo; said he, with a very
slight foreign accentuation of the words. &ldquo;It is only at times like this
that people&mdash;very excellent and amiable people, doubtless&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, to be sure they are,&rdquo; interrupted she, impatiently; &ldquo;but let us speak
of something else. Is that your clairvoyant Princess yonder?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my Lady; she has just revealed to us what was doing at the Crimea.
She says that two of the English advanced batteries have slackened their
fire for want of ammunition, and that a deserter was telling Todleben of
the reason at the moment She is <i>en rapport</i> with her sister, who is
now at Sebastopol.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And are we to be supposed to credit this?&rdquo; asked my Lord.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I can only aver that I believe it, my Lord,&rdquo; said Lanfranchi, whose
massive head and intensely acute features denoted very little intellectual
weakness.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wish you 'd ask her why are we lingering so long in this dreary place?&rdquo;
 sighed Lady Lackington, peevishly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;She answered that question yesterday, my Lady,&rdquo; replied he, quietly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How was that? Who asked her? What did she say?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was the Baron von Glum that asked; and her answer was, 'Expecting a
disappointment.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very gratifying intelligence, I must say. Did you hear that, my Lord?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I heard it, and I have placed it in my mind in the same category as
her Crimean news.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Can she inform us when we are to get away?&rdquo; asked her Ladyship.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;She mentioned to-morrow evening as the time, my Lady,&rdquo; said the doctor,
calmly.
</p>
<p>
A faint laugh of derisive meaning was Lady Lackington's only reply; and
the doctor gravely remarked: &ldquo;There is more in these things than we like
to credit; perhaps our very sense of inferiority in presence of such
prediction is a bar to our belief. We do not willingly lend ourselves to a
theory which at once excludes us from the elect of prophecy.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Could she tell us who'll win the Derby?&rdquo; said Spicer, joining the
colloquy. But a glance from her Ladyship at once recalled him from the
indiscreet familiarity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you think she could pronounce whose is the arrival that makes such a
clatter outside?&rdquo; said Lord Lackington, as a tremendous chorus of
whip-cracking announced the advent of something very important; and the
doctor hurried off to receive the visitor. Already a large
travelling-carriage, drawn by eight horses, and followed by a &ldquo;fourgon&rdquo;
 with four, had drawn up before the great entrance, and a courier,
gold-banded and whiskered, and carrying a most imposingly swollen
money-bag, was ringing stoutly for admittance. When Dr. Lanfranchi had
exchanged a few words with the courier, he approached the window of the
carriage, and, bowing courteously, proceeded to welcome the traveller.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your apartments have been ready since the sixteenth, sir; and we hoped
each day to have seen you arrive.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Have your visitors all gone?&rdquo; asked the stranger, in a low quiet tone.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, sir; the fine weather has induced many to prolong their stay. We have
the Princess Labanoff, Lord Lackington, the Countess Grembinski, the Duke
of Terra di Monte, the Lady Grace&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The traveller, however, paid little attention to the Catalogue, but with
the aid of the courier on one side and his-valet on the other, slowly
descended from the carriage. If he availed himself of their assistance,
there was little in his appearance that seemed to warrant its necessity.
He was a large, powerfully built man, something beyond the prime of life,
but whose build announced considerable vigor. Slightly stooped in the
shoulders, the defect seemed to add to the fixity of his look, for the
head was thus thrown more forward, and the expression of the deep-set
eyes, overshadowed by shaggy gray eyebrows, rendered more piercing and
direct His features were massive and regular, their character that of
solemnity and gravity; and as he removed his cap, he displayed a high,
bold forehead with what phrenologists would have called an extravagant
development of the organs of locality. Indeed, these overhanging masses
almost imparted an air of retreating to a head that was singularly
straight.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A number of letters have arrived for you, and you will find them in your
room, sir,&rdquo; continued Lanfranchi, as he escorted him towards the stairs. A
quiet bow acknowledged this speech, and the doctor went on: &ldquo;I was charged
with a message from Lord Lackington, too, who desired me to say that he
hoped to see you as soon as possible after your arrival. May I inform him
when you could receive him?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not to-night; some time to-morrow, about twelve o'clock, or half-past, if
that will suit him,&rdquo; said the stranger, coldly. &ldquo;Is Baron Glumthal here?
Well, tell him to come up to me, and let them send me some tea.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;May I mention your arrival to his Lordship, for I know his great
anxiety?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just as you please,&rdquo; said the other, in the same quiet tone; while he
bowed in a fashion to dismiss his visitor.
</p>
<p>
Having glanced casually at the addresses of a number of letters, he only
opened one or two, and looked cursorily over their contents; and then
opening a window which looked over the lake, he placed a chair on the
balcony and sat down, as if to rest and reflect in the fresh and still
night air. It was a calm and quiet atmosphere,&mdash;not a leaf stirred,
not a ripple moved the glassy surface of the lake; so that, as he sat, he
could overhear Dr. Lanfranchi's voice beneath announcing his arrival to
Lord Lackington.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If he can receive Glumthal, why can't he see <i>me?</i>&rdquo; asked the
Viscount, testily. &ldquo;You must go back and tell him that I desire
particularly to meet him this evening.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If you wish, my Lord&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I do, sir,&rdquo; repeated he, more peremptorily. &ldquo;Lady Lackington and myself
have been sojourning here the last three weeks, awaiting this arrival, and
I am at a loss to see why our patience is to be pushed further. Pray take
him my message, therefore.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The doctor, without speaking, left the room at once.
</p>
<p>
Lanfranchi was some minutes in the apartment before he discovered where
the stranger was sitting, and then approaching him softly he communicated
his Lordship's request.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am afraid you must allow me to take my own way. I have contracted an
unfortunate habit in that respect,&rdquo; said the stranger, with a quiet smile.
&ldquo;Give my compliments to his Lordship, and say that at twelve to-morrow I
am at his orders; and tell Baron Glumthal that I expect him now.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Lanfranchi withdrew; and having whispered the message to the Baron,
proceeded to make his communication to the Viscount.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; said Lord Lackington, haughtily interrupting; &ldquo;something
like an apology. Men of this sort have a business-like standard even for
their politeness, and there is no necessity for me to teach them something
better;&rdquo; and then, turning to Twining, he added, &ldquo;That was Dunn's arrival
we heard awhile ago.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, indeed! Very glad,&mdash;quite rejoiced on your account more than my
own. Dunn&mdash;Dunn; remarkable man&mdash;very,&rdquo; said Twining, hurriedly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thank Heaven! we may be able to get away from this place to-morrow or
next day,&rdquo; said Lord Lackington, sighing drearily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, of course; very slow for your Lordship&mdash;no society&mdash;nothing
to do.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And the weather beginning to break?&rdquo; said Lord Lackington, peevishly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just so, as your Lordship most justly observes,&mdash;the weather
beginning to break.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Look at that troop of horses,&rdquo; said the Viscount, as the postilions
passed beneath the window in a long file with the cattle just released
from the travelling-carriages. &ldquo;There goes ten&mdash;no, but twelve
posters. He travels right royally, doesn't he?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very handsomely, indeed; quite a pleasure to see it,&rdquo; said Twining,
gleefully.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;These fellows have little tact, with all their worldly shrewdness, or
they 'd not make such ostentatious display of their wealth.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Quite true, my Lord. It <i>is</i> indiscreet of them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is so like saying, 'This is <i>our</i> day! '&rdquo; said the Viscount.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So it is, my Lord; and a very pleasant day they have of it, I must say;
clever men&mdash;shrewd men&mdash;know the world thoroughly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'm not so very sure of that, Twining,&rdquo; said his Lordship, smiling half
superciliously. &ldquo;If they really had all the worldly knowledge you
attribute to them, they 'd scarcely venture to shock the feelings of
society by assumptions of this sort They would have more patience,
Twining,&mdash;more patience.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So they would, my Lord. Capital thing,&mdash;excellent thing, patience;
always rewarded in the end; great fun.&rdquo; And he rubbed his hands and
laughed away pleasantly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And they'll defeat themselves, that's what will come of it, sir,&rdquo; said
Lord Lackington, not heeding the other's remark.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I quite agree with your Lordship,&rdquo; chimed in Twining.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And shall I tell you why they 'll defeat themselves, sir?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Like it of all things; take it as a great favor on your Lordship's part.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;For this reason, Twining, that they have no 'prestige,'&mdash;no,
Twining, they have no prestige. Now, sir, wealth unassociated with
prestige is just like&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;it is, as it were, a
sort of local rank,&mdash;a kind of thing like being brigadier in the
Bombay Army, but only a lieutenant when you 're at home; so long,
therefore, as these fellows are rich, they have their influence. Let them
suffer a reverse of fortune, however, and where will they be, sir?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Can't possibly say; but quite certain your Lordship knows,&mdash;perfectly
sure of it,&rdquo; rattled out Twining.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I do, sir. It is a subject on which I have bestowed considerable thought.
I may go further, and say, one which I have reduced to a sort of theory.
These men are signs of the times,&mdash;emblems of our era; just like the
cholera, the electric telegraph, or the gold-fields of Australia. We must
not accept them as normal, do you perceive? They are the abnormal
incidents of our age.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Quite true, most just, very like the electric telegraph!&rdquo; muttered
Twining.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And by that very condition only exercising a passing influence on our
society, sir,&rdquo; said his Lordship, pursuing his own train of thought.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Perfectly correct, rapid as lightning.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And when they do pass away, sir,&rdquo; continued the Viscount, &ldquo;they leave no
trace of their existence behind them. The bubble buret, the surface of the
stream remains without a ripple. I myself may live to see; you, in all
probability, will live to see.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your Lordship far more likely,&mdash;sincerely trust as much,&rdquo; said
Twining, bowing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, sir, it matters little which of us is to witness the extinction of
this Plutocracy.&rdquo; And as his Lordship enunciated this last word, he walked
off like one who had totally exhausted his subject.

<h2>
CHAPTER VIII. MR. DUNN.
</h2>
<p>
MR. Davenport Dunn sat at breakfast in his spacious chamber overlooking
the Lake of Como. In addition to the material appliances of that meal, the
table was covered with newly arrived letters, and newspapers, maps,
surveys, railroad sections, and Parliamentary blue-books littered about,
along with chalk drawings, oil miniatures, some carvings in box and ivory,
and a few bronzes of rare beauty and design. Occasionally skimming over
the newspapers, now sipping his tea, or now examining some object of art
through a magnifier, he dallied over his meal like one who felt the time
thus passed a respite from the task of the day. At last he walked out,
and, leaning over the balcony, gazed at the glorious landscape at his
feet. It was early morning, and the great masses of misty clouds were
slowly beginning to move up the Alps, disclosing as they went spots of
bright green verdure, dark-sided ravines and cataracts, amid patches of
pine forest, or dreary tracts of snow still lying deep in the mountain
clefts. Beautiful as was the picture of the lake itself, and the wooded
promontories along it, his eyes never turned from the rugged grandeur of
the Alpine range, which he continued to gaze at for a long time. So
absorbed was he in his contemplation, that he never noticed the approach
of another, and Baron Glumthal was already leaning over the balustrade
beside him ere he had perceived him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, is it more assuring now that you have looked at it?&rdquo; asked the
German, in English, of which there was the very slightest trace of a
foreign accent.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I see nothing to deter one from the project,&rdquo; said Dunn, slowly. &ldquo;These
questions resolve themselves purely into two conditions,&mdash;time and
money. The grand army was only a corporal's guard, multiplied by hundreds
of thousands.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But the difficulties&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Difficulties!&rdquo; broke in Dunn; &ldquo;thank Heaven for them, Baron, or you and I
would be no better off in this world than the herd about us. Strong heads
and stout hearts are the breaching artillery of mankind,&mdash;you can
find rank and file any day.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;When I said difficulties, I might have used a stronger word.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Dunn, smiling, &ldquo;I'd rather contract to turn the Alps
yonder, than to drive a new idea into the heads of a people. See here,
now,&rdquo; said he, entering the room, and returning with a large plan in his
hand, &ldquo;this is Chiavenna. Well, the levels show that a line drawn from
this spot comes out below Andeer, at a place called Mühlen,&mdash;the
distance something less than twenty-two miles. By Brumall's contract, you
will perceive that if he don't meet with water&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But in that lies the whole question,&rdquo; broke in the other.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I know it, and I am not going to blink it. I mean to take the
alternatives in turn.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Shall I spare you a deal of trouble, Dunn?&rdquo; said the German, laying his
hand on his arm. &ldquo;Our house has decided against the enterprise. I have no
need to explain the reasons.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And can you be swayed by such counsels?&rdquo; cried Dunn, eagerly. &ldquo;Is it
possible that you will suffer yourselves to be made the dupes of a Russian
intrigue?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Say, rather, the agents of a great policy,&rdquo; said Glumthal, &ldquo;and you will
be nearer the mark. My dear friend,&rdquo; added he, in a lower and more
confidential tone, &ldquo;have I to tell <i>you</i> that <i>your</i> whole late
policy in England is a mistake, your Crimean war a mistake, your French
alliance a mistake, and your present attempt at a reconciliation with
Austria the greatest mistake of all?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You would find it a hard task to make the nation believe this,&rdquo; said
Dunn, smiling.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So I might; but not to convince your statesmen of it. They see it
already. They perceive even now some of the perils of the coarse they have
adopted.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The old story. I have heard it at least a hundred times,&rdquo; broke in Dunn.
&ldquo;We have been overturning the breakwaters that the ocean may swamp us. But
I tell <i>you</i>, Baron, that the more democratic we grow in England, the
safer we become. We don't want these alliances we fancied ourselves once
in need of. That family compact redounded but little to our advantage.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So it might. But there is another compact now forming, which bodes even
less favorably to you. The Church, by her Concordat, is replacing the old
Holy Alliance. You 'll need the aid of the only power that cannot be drawn
into this league,&mdash;I mean the only great power,&mdash;Russia.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If you will wait till we are so minded, Baron,&rdquo; said Dunn, laughing, &ldquo;you
have plenty of time to help me with my tunnel here.&rdquo; And he pointed to his
plans.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And where will the world be,&mdash;I mean your world and mine,&mdash;before
the pick of the workman reaches so far?&rdquo; and he placed his finger on the
Splugen Alps,&mdash;&ldquo;answer me that. What will be the Government of
France,&mdash;I don't ask who? Where will Naples be? What king will be
convoking the Hungarian Diet? Who will be the Russian viceroy on the
Danube?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Far more to the purpose were it if I could tell you how would the Three
per Cents stand,&rdquo; broke in Dunn.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'm coming to that,&rdquo; said the other, dryly. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said he, after a
pause; &ldquo;let us see this unhappy war finished,&mdash;let us wait till we
know who are to be partners in the-great game of European politics.
Lanfranchi tells me that the French and Russians who meet here come
together on the best of terms; that intimacies, and even friendships.
spring up rapidly between them. This fact, if repeated in Downing Street,
might be heard with some misgiving.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Though Dunn affected indifference to this remark, he winced, and walked to
the window to hide his irritation.
</p>
<p>
Immediately beneath where he stood, a trellised vine-walk led down to the
lake, where the boats were usually in waiting; and from this alley now a
number of voices could be heard, although the speakers were entirely
hidden by the foliage. The gay and laughing tones indicated a
pleasure-party; and such it was, bent on a picnic to Bellaggio. Some were
loud in praises of the morning, and the splendid promise of the day;
others discussed how many boats they should want, and how the party was to
be divided.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Americans with the Russians,&rdquo; said Twining, slapping his legs and
laughing; &ldquo;great friends&mdash;capital allies&mdash;what fun! Ourselves
and the O'Reillys.&mdash;Spicer, look out, and see if they are coming.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And do you mean to say you'll not come?&rdquo; whispered a very soft voice,
after the crowd had passed on.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Charmante Molly!&rdquo; said Lord Lackington, in his most dulcet of accents, &ldquo;I
am quite heart-broken at the disappointment; but when I tell you that this
man has come some hundreds of miles to meet me here,&mdash;that the matter
is one of deepest importance&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And who is he? Could you make him come too?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Impossible, <i>ma belle</i>. He is quite unsuited to this kind of thing,&mdash;a
mere creature of parchments. The very sight of him would only suggest
thoughts of foreclosing mortgages and renewal fines.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How I hate him!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do, dearest,&mdash;hate him to your heart's content,&mdash;and for
nothing more than the happiness of which he robs me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I 'm sure, I did think&mdash;&rdquo; And she stopped, and seemed
confused.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what, pray, was it that you did think?&rdquo; said his Lordship, most
winningly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I thought two things, then, if you must know,&rdquo; said she, archly: &ldquo;first,
that a great personage like your Lordship would make a very small one like
this Mr. Dunn understand it was his duty to await your convenience; and my
second thought was&mdash;But perhaps you don't care to hear it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of all things. Pray go on.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, then, my second was that if I asked you to come, you'd not refuse
me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What an inexorable charmer it is!&rdquo; cried he, in stage fashion. &ldquo;Do you
fancy you could ever forgive yourself if, yielding to this temptation, I
were really to miss this man?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You told me yourself, only yesterday,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;<i>ce que femme veut</i>&mdash;Besides,
you'll have him all day tomorrow, and the next, and&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, so be it. See how I hug my chains!&rdquo; said he, drawing her arm within
his, and moving on towards the boat.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Were you to be of that party, Baron?&rdquo; asked Dunn, pointing to the crowd
beside the lake.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So I was. The Princess engaged me last night; they are going to the
Plinniana and Bellaggio. Why not join us?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I have a score of letters to write, and double as many to read. In
fact, I have kept all my work for a quiet day in this nice tranquil spot I
wish I could take a week here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And why not do it? Have n't you yet learned that it is the world's duty
to wait on <i>us?</i> For my own part, I have always found that one
emerges from these secluded places with renewed energy and awakened vigor.
I heard Stadeon once say that when anything puzzled him, he went to pass a
day at Maria Zell, and he never came away without hitting on the solution.
They are beckoning to me; so good-bye!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Anything puzzled him!&rdquo; muttered Dunn, repeating the words of the other's
story. &ldquo;If he but knew that what puzzles <i>me</i> at this moment is
myself!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The very nature of the correspondence that then littered his table might
well warrant what he felt. Who, and what was he, to whom great ministers
wrote confidentially, and secretaries of state began, &ldquo;My dear Dunn&rdquo;? How
had he risen to this eminence? What were the gifts by which he held, and
was to maintain it? Most men who have attained to high station from small
beginnings, have so conformed to the exigencies of each new change in life
as to carry but little of what they started with to their position of
eminence; gradually assimilating to the circumstances around them as they
went, they flung the past behind them, only occupied with those qualities
which should fit them for the future. Not so Davenport Dunn: he was ever
present to his own eyes as the son of the very humblest parentage; as the
poor boy educated by charity, struggling drearily through years of
poverty,&mdash;the youth discouraged and slighted, the man repulsed and
rejected. Certain incidents of his life never left him; there they were,
as if photographed on his heart; and at will he could behold himself as he
was turned away ignominiously from Kellett's house; or a morning scarce
less sad, as he learned his rejection for the sizarship; or the day still
more bitter that Lord Glengariff put him out of doors, with words of
insult and shame. Like avenging spirits, these memories travelled with him
wherever he journeyed. They sat beside him as he dined at great men's
tables; they loitered with him in his lonely walks, and whispered into his
ear in the dark hours of the night. No high-hearted hope, no elevating
self-reliance, had sustained him through these youthful reverses; each new
failure, on the contrary, seemed to have impressed him more and more
strongly with the conviction that the gifts which win success in life had
not been vouchsafed him; that his abilities were of that humble order
which never elevate their possessor above mere mediocrity; that if he
meant to strive for the great prizes of life, it must be less by
addressing himself to great intellectual efforts than by a patient study
of men themselves,&mdash;of their frailties, their weaknesses, and their
follies. Whatever he had seen of the world had shown him how invariably
the greatest minds were alloyed with some deteriorating influence, and
that passions of one kind or other, ambitions more or less worthy, even
the subtlety of flattery, swayed those whose intellects soared loftily
among their fellows. &ldquo;I cannot share in the tilt with these,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;Mine are no gifts of eloquence or imaginative power; I am not versed in
the mysteries of science, nor deep-read in the intricacies of law. Let me,
however, see if I cannot, by dexterity, accomplish what is denied to my
strength. Every man, whatever his station, covets wealth. The noblest and
the meanest, the man dignified by exalted aspirations, the true creature
of selfish enjoyments, are all alike enlisted in the pursuit. Let me
consider how this common tendency may be best turned to account. To enrich
others, it is not necessary that I should be wealthy myself. The
geographer may safely dictate the route by which the explorer is to
journey through a desert he has never travelled himself. The great
problems of finance can be worked by suggestions in a garret, though their
application may demand millions.&rdquo; Starting thus from an humble attorney in
a country town, he gradually grew to be known as a most capable adviser in
all monetary matters. Rich men consulted him about profitable investments
and safe employment of their capital; embarrassed men confided to him
their difficulties, and sought his aid to meet them; speculators asked his
advice as to this or that venture; and even those who gambled on the
eventful fortunes of a ministry were fain to be guided by his wise
predictions. &ldquo;Dunn has got me the money on reasonable terms;&rdquo; &ldquo;Dunn has
managed to let me have five per cent;&rdquo; &ldquo;Dunn assures me I may risk this;&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Dunn tells me that they 'll carry the bill next session,&rdquo;&mdash;such and
such things were the phrases one heard at every turn, till his opinion
became a power in the land, and he grew to feel it so.
</p>
<p>
This first step led to another and higher one. Through the moneyed
circumstances of men he came to learn their moral natures: against what
temptations this one was proof; to what that other would yield; what were
the goals for which each was striving; what the secret doubts and
misgivings that beset them. What the doctor was to the world of sickness
and infirmity did he become to the world of human passion and desire. Men
came to him with the same unreserve; they stripped before him and laid
bare the foul spots of their heart's disease, as though it were but
repeating the story to themselves. Terrible and harrowing as are the tales
which reach the physician's ears, the stories revealed to his were more
terrible and harrowing still. They came to him with narratives of reckless
waste and ruin; with histories of debt that dated a century back; with
worse, far worse,&mdash;with tales of forgery and fraud. Crimes for which
the law would have exacted its last expiation were whispered to him in
that dreary confessional, his private office, and the evidences of guilt
placed in his hands that he might read and reflect over them. And as the
doctor moves through life with the sad knowledge of all the secret
suffering around him,&mdash;how little that &ldquo;flush&rdquo; indicates of health,
how faintly beats the heart that seems to swell with happiness,&mdash;so
did this man walk a world that was a mere hospital ward of moral
rottenness. Why should the priest and the physician be the only men to
trade upon the infirmities of human nature? Why should they be the sole
depositaries of those mysteries by which men's actions can be swayed and
moulded? By what temptations are men so assailable as those that touch
their material fortunes, and why not make this moral country an especial
study? Such were his theory and his practice.
</p>
<p>
There is often a remarkable fitness&mdash;may we call it a
&ldquo;pre-established harmony&rdquo;?&mdash;between men and the circumstances of
their age, and this has led to the opinion that it is by the events
themselves the agents are developed; we incline to think differently, as
the appearance of both together is rather in obedience to some over-ruling
edict of Providence which has alike provided the work and the workmen. It
would be a shallow reading of history to imagine Cromwell the child of the
Revolution, or Napoleon as the accident of the battle of the sections.
</p>
<p>
Davenport Dunn sprang into eminence when, by the action of the Encumbered
Estates Court, a great change was operated in the condition of Ireland. To
grasp at once the immense consequences of a tremendous social revolution&mdash;to
foresee even some of the results of this sweeping confiscation&mdash;required
no common knowledge of the country, and no small insight into its habits.
The old feudalism that had linked the fate of a starving people with the
fortunes of a ruined gentry was to be extinguished at once, and a great
experiment tried. Was Ireland to be more governable in prosperity than in
adversity? This was a problem which really might not seem to challenge
much doubt, and yet was it by no means devoid of difficulty to those minds
who had long based their ideas of ruling that land on the principles of
fomenting its dissensions and separating its people. Davenport Dunn saw
the hesitation of the moment, and offered himself at once to solve the
difficulty. The transfer of property might be conducted in such a way as
to favor the views of a particular party in the state; the new proprietary
might be selected, and the aim of a government consulted in the
establishment of this new squirearchy. He thought so, at least, and, what
is more, he persuaded a chief secretary to believe him.
</p>
<p>
Nothing reads more simply than the sale of an encumbered estate: &ldquo;In the
matter of Sir Roger O'Moore, Bart, Brian O'Moore, and Margaret Halliday,
owners, and Paul May-bey, petitioner, the Commissioners will, on Friday
next, at the hour of noon,&rdquo;&mdash;and so on; and then come the descriptive
particulars of Carrickross, Dummaymagan, and Lantygoree, with Griffith's
valuation and the ordnance survey, concluding with a recital of all the
penalties, reservations, covenants, clauses, &amp;c., with the modest
mention of twenty-odd pounds some shillings tithe-rent charge, for a
finish. To dispossess of this a man that never really owned it for the
last forty years, and invest it in another, who never saw it, was the easy
operation of the auctioneer's hammer; and with a chief commissioner to
ratify the sale, few things seemed easier than the whole process. Still,
there are certain aspects in the transaction which suggest reflection.
What were the ties, what the relations, between the original owner and the
tenantry who held under him? What kind of social system had bound them,&mdash;what
were the mutual services they rendered each other? For the reverence and
respect tendered on one side, and for the thousand little charities and
kindnesses bestowed on the other, what was to be the compensation? How was
that guidance and direction, more or less inherent in those who are the
heads of a neighborhood, to be replaced? Was it quite certain that the
incoming proprietor would care to study the habits, the tastes, and the
tempers of the peasantry on his estate, learn their ways, or understand
their difficulties? And, lastly, what new political complexion would the
country wear? Would it become more Conservative or more Whig, more
Democratic or more Saxon?
</p>
<p>
Davenport Dunn's opinion was that the case was precisely that of a new
colony, where the first settlers, too busy about their material interests
to care for mere speculative questions, would attach themselves heartily
to any existing government, giving their adhesion to whatever afforded
protection to their property and safety to their lives. &ldquo;Take this new
colony,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;into your especial care, and their sons and grandsons
will be yours after-wards. A new regiment is being raised; write your own
legends on their colors, and they are your own.&rdquo; He sketched out a system
by which this new squirearchy was to be dealt with,&mdash;how courted,
flattered, and rewarded. He showed how, in attaching them to the State,
the government of the country might be rendered more easy, and the dreaded
influence of the priest be antagonized most effectually; and, finally,
demonstrated that Ireland, which had been the stereotyped difficulty of
every administration, might now be turned into a stronghold against
opposition.
</p>
<p>
To replace the great proprietary whose estates were now in the market by a
new constituency in accordance with his views was, therefore, his general
scheme, and he addressed himself to this task with all his peculiar
energy. He organized the registry of all the encumbered estates of
Ireland, with every detail which could illustrate the various advantages;
he established an immense correspondence with English capitalists eager
for new investments; he possessed himself of intimate knowledge of all the
variations and fluctuations which attend the money market at certain
periods, so that he knew the most favorable moments to suggest
speculation; and, lastly, he had craft enough to carry his system into
operation without any suspicion being attached to it; and was able to say
to a Viceroy, &ldquo;Look and judge for yourself, my Lord, whose influence is
now paramount in Ireland.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Truly, it was not easy for a government to ignore him; his name turned up
at every moment. From the stirring incident of a great county election to
the small contest for a poor-law guardianship, he figured everywhere,
until every question of policy became coupled with the inevitable demand,
&ldquo;What does Dunn think of it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Like all men of strong ambition, he encouraged few or no intimacies; he
had actually no friendships. He wanted no counsels; nor would he have
stooped to have laid a case for advice before any one. Partly in
consequence of this, he was spoken of generally in terms of depreciation
and discredit. Some called him lucky,&mdash;a happy phrase that adapts
itself to any fancy; some said he was a commonplace, vulgar fellow, with
certain business aptitudes, but quite incapable of any wide or extended
views; some, again, went further, and said he was the mere tool of certain
clever heads that did not care to figure in the foreground; and not a few
wondered that &ldquo;a man of this kind&rdquo; should have ever attained to any
eminence or station in the land.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You 'll see how his Excellency will turn him to account; he knows how to
deal with fellows of this stamp,&rdquo; said a private secretary in the Castle.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have no doubt, sir, Mr. Davenport Dunn would agree with you,&rdquo; said the
Attorney-General, with a sneer; &ldquo;but the opinion would be bad in law!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He 's not very much of a churchman, I suspect,&rdquo; whispered a bishop; &ldquo;but
we find him occasionally useful.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He serves <i>our</i> purpose!&rdquo; pompously spoke a country gentleman, who
really, in the sentiment, represented a class.
</p>
<p>
Such was the man who now sat alone, communing with himself, in his room at
the Villa d'Este. Let us believe that he had enough to think of.

<h2>
CHAPTER IX. A DAY ON THE LAKE OF COMO.
</h2>
<p>
We fully sympathize with Lord Lackington, who preferred the picnic and the
society of Miss Molly O'Reilly to the cares of business and an interview
with Davenport Dunn. The Lake of Como, on a fine day of summer or early
autumn, and with a heart moderately free from the anxieties and sorrows of
life, is a very enjoyable locality, and essentially so to a man of the
world like the noble Viscount, who liked to have the more romantic
features of the scene blended with associations of ease and pleasure, and
be able to turn from the contemplation of Alpine ruggedness to the sight
of some terraced garden, glowing in the luxuriance of its vegetation.
Never, perhaps, was there ever a spot so calculated to appeal successfully
to the feelings of men of his stamp. There was mountain grandeur and
desolation, snow-peak and precipice; but all in the back distance, not
near enough to suggest even the fear of cold, or the disagreeable idea of
a sledge journey. There were innumerable villas of every style and class,&mdash;some
spacious and splendid enough for royal residences; others coquettish
little chalets, where lovers might pass the honeymoon. There were tasteful
pavilions over the very lake; snug spots where solitude might love to
ponder, a student read, or an idler enjoy his cigar, in the most enviable
of scenes. Trellised vine-walks zigzagged up the hills to some picturesque
shrine whose modest little spire rose above the olive-trees, or some rude
steps in the rock led down to a little nook, whole white sands glistened
beneath the crystal waters,&mdash;such a bath as no Sybarite, in all his
most glowing fancy, ever imagined. And amid all and through all there was
that air of wealth&mdash;that assurance of affluence and abundance&mdash;which
comes so home to the hearts of men whose sense of enjoyment can only be
gratified where there is to be no sacrifice to their love of ease. In the
noble Viscount's estimation, the place was perfect It was even associated
with the solitary bit of romance of his whole life. It was here that he
passed the first few weeks after his wedding; and though he had preserved
very little of those feelings which imparted happiness to that period,
though her Ladyship did not recall to his mind the attractions which once
had fascinated him,&mdash;new glazed and new lacquered over and over again
as was the vase, &ldquo;the scent of the roses had clung to it still,&rdquo; The
distance that lends enchantment to the material has also its influence on
the moral picture. Memory softens and subdues many a harsh tint, mellows
many an incongruity, and blends into a pleasant harmony many things which
in their proximity were the reverse of agreeable. Not that we would be
understood to say that Lord Lackington's honeymoon was not like yours, an
elysium of happiness and bliss; we would simply imply that, in recalling
it, he only remembered the rose-tints, and never brought up one of the
shadows. He had, in his own fashion, poetized that little episode of his
life, when, dressed in a fancy and becoming costume, he played gondolier
to his young bride, scaled the mountain to fetch her Alp-roses, and read
aloud &ldquo;Childe Harold,&rdquo; as he interpolated Harrow recollections of its
author. Not one of these did he now remember; he'd as soon have dreamed of
being marker at a billiard table as of playing the barcarole; and as to
mountain excursions he 'd not have bargained for any success that required
the exertion of a steep staircase.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There 's a little villa in a bay somewhere hereabouts,&rdquo; said he, as the
boat glided smoothly along; &ldquo;I should like much to show it to you.&rdquo; This
was addressed to Molly O'Reilly, who sat beside him. &ldquo;Do you happen to
know La Pace?&rdquo; asked he of one of the boatmen.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure I do, Eccellenza. Who doesn't? My own father was barcarole
there to a great Milordo, I can't say how many years back. Ah,&rdquo; added he,
laughing, &ldquo;what stories he used to have of that same Milordo, who was
always dressing himself up to be as a gondolier or a chamois-hunter.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We have n't asked for your father's memoirs, my good fellow; we only
wanted you to show us where La Pace lies,&rdquo; said the Viscount, testily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There it is, then, Eccellenza,&rdquo; said the man, as they rounded a little
promontory of rock, and came in full view of a small cove, in the centre
of which stood the villa.
</p>
<p>
Untenanted and neglected as it was, there was yet about it that glorious
luxuriance of vegetation, that rare growth of vines and olive and oleander
and cactus which seems to more than compensate all the care and
supervision of men. The overloaded orange-trees dipped their weary
branches in the lake, where the golden balls rose and fell as the water
surged about them. The tangled vines sprawled over the ground, staining
the deep grass with their purple blood. Olive berries lay deep around, and
a thousand perfumes loaded the air as the faint breeze stirred it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let me show you a true Italian villa,&rdquo; said the Viscount, as the boat
glided up to the steps cut in the marble rock. &ldquo;I once passed a few weeks
here; a caprice seized me to know what kind of life it would be to loiter
amidst olive groves, and have no other company than the cicala and the
green lizard.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faith, my Lord,&rdquo; said O'Reilly, &ldquo;if you could live upon figs and lemons,
you 'd have nothing to complain of; but I 'm thinking you found it
lonely.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I scarcely remember, but my impression is, I liked it,&rdquo; said he, with a
slight hesitation. &ldquo;I used to lie under the great cedar yonder, and read
Petrarch.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Capital fun&mdash;excellent&mdash;live here for two hundred a year, or
even less&mdash;plenty of fish in the lake&mdash;keep the servants on
watermelons,&rdquo; said Twining, slapping his legs, as he made this domestic
calculation to himself.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;With people one liked about one,&rdquo; said Miss O'Reilly, &ldquo;I don't see why
this should n't be a delicious spot.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There's not a hundred yards of background. You could n't give a horse
walking exercise here if your life was on it,&rdquo; said Spicer,
contemptuously.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Splendid grapes, wonderful oranges, finest melons I ever saw,&mdash;all
going to waste too,&rdquo; said Twining, laughing, as if such utter neglect was
a very droll thing. &ldquo;Get this place a bargain,&mdash;might have it for a
mere nothing.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So you might, O'Reilly,&rdquo; said the Viscount; &ldquo;it is one of those deserted
spots that are picked up for a tenth of their value; buy it, fit it up
handsomely, and we'll come and spend the autumn with you,&mdash;won't we,
Twining?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Upon my life we will, I 'll swear it; be here 1st September to the day,
and stay till&mdash;as long as you please. Great fun!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Delicious spot to come and repose in from the cares and worries of life,&rdquo;
 said Lord Lackington, as he stretched upon a bench and began peeling an
orange.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'd get the blue devils in a week; I 'd be found hanging some fine
morning&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;For shame, papa,&rdquo; broke in Molly. &ldquo;My Lord says he 'd come on a visit to
us, and you know we 'd only be here in the autumn.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just so&mdash;come here for the wine season&mdash;get in your olives and
look after your oil&mdash;great fun,&rdquo; chimed in Twining, merrily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I declare, I 'd like it of all things, would not you?&rdquo; said the elder
girl to Spicer, who had now begun to reflect that there was a kind of
straw-yard season for men as well as for hunters,&mdash;when the great
object was to live cheap and husband your resources; and as he ruminated
over the lazy quietness of an existence that would cost nothing, when even
his &ldquo;Bell's Life&rdquo; should be inserted amongst the family extraordinaires,
he vouchsafed to approve the scheme; and in his mumbling tone, in
imitation of Heaven knows what celebrated sporting character, he grumbled
out, &ldquo;Make the governor go in for it by all means!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Twining had entered into the project most eagerly. One of the most marked
traits of his singular mind was not merely to enjoy his own pre-eminence
in wealth over so many others, but to chuckle over all the possible
mistakes which <i>he</i> had escaped and <i>they</i> had fallen into. To
know that there was a speculation whose temptation he had resisted and
which had engulfed all who engaged in it; to see the bank fail whose
directorship he had refused, or the railroad smashed whose preference
shares he had rejected,&mdash;this was an intense delight to him; and on
such occasions was it that he slapped his lean legs most enthusiastically,
and exclaimed, &ldquo;What fun!&rdquo; with the true zest of enjoyment.
</p>
<p>
To plant a man of O'Reilly's stamp in such a soil seemed, therefore, about
the best practical joke he had ever heard of; and so he walked him over
the villa, discoursing eloquently on all the advantages of the project,&mdash;the
great social position it would confer, the place he would occupy in the
country, the soundness of the investment, the certainty of securing great
matches for the girls. What a view that window opened of the Splugen Alps!
What a delicious spot, this little room, to sip one's claret of an autumn
evening! Think of the dessert growing almost into the very dining-room,
and your trout leaping within a yard of the breakfast-table! Austrians
charmed to have you&mdash;make you a count&mdash;a Hof something or other,
at once&mdash;give you a cross&mdash;great fun, eh?&mdash;Graf O'Reilly&mdash;sound
admirably&mdash;do it, by all means!
</p>
<p>
While Twining's attack was being conducted in this fashion, Lord
Lackington was not less industriously pursuing his plan of campaign
elsewhere. He had sauntered with Molly into the garden and a little
pavilion at the end of it, where the lake was seen in one of its most
picturesque aspects. It was a well-known spot to him; he had passed many
an evening on that low window-seat, half dreamingly forgetting himself in
the peaceful scene, half consciously recalling pleasant nights at
Brookes's and gay dinners at Carlton House. Here was it that he first grew
hipped with matrimony, and so sated with its happiness that he actually
began to long for any little disaster that might dash the smooth monotony
of his life; and yet now, by one of those strange tricks memory plays us,
he fancied that the moments he had once passed here had never been
equalled in all his after-life.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm certain, though you won't confess,&rdquo; said she, after one of his most
eloquent bursts of remembered enjoyment,&mdash;&ldquo;I 'm certain you were very
much in love those days.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;An ideal passion, perhaps, a poetized vision of that bright creature who
should, one day or other, sway this poor heart;&rdquo; and he flattened the
creases of his spotless white waistcoat; &ldquo;but if you mean that I knew of
any, had ever seen any, until now, this very moment&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stop! remember your promise,&rdquo; said she, laughing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But, <i>charmante</i> Molly, I 'm only mortal,&rdquo; said he, with an air of
such superb humility that made her at once remember it was a peer who said
it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mortals must keep their words,&rdquo; said she, pertly. &ldquo;The condition on which
I consented to accept your companionship was&mdash;But I need n't remind
you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, do not, dear Molly, for I shall be delighted to forget it. You are
aware that no law ever obliged a man to do what was impossible; and that
to exact any pledge from him to such an end is in itself an illegality.
You little suspected, therefore, that it was you, not I, was the
delinquent.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;'All I know is, that you assured me you 'd not&mdash;you 'd not talk
nonsense,&rdquo; said she, blushing deeply, half angry, half ashamed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh! never guessed you were here,&rdquo; broke in Twining, as he peeped through
the window. &ldquo;Sweet spot&mdash;so quiet and secluded&mdash;capital fun!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is <i>such</i> a view from this, papa,&rdquo; said Molly, in some
confusion at Twining's bantering look; &ldquo;come round and see it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have just been telling this dear girl of yours, O'Reilly, that you
ought to make this place your own,&rdquo; said Lord Lackington. &ldquo;Don't fancy you
'd be out of the world here. Why, there 's the Villa d'Este, a European
celebrity at once; it will be thronged next year to suffocation. The
'Galignani,' I see, has already mentioned myself and Lady Lackington as
among the visitors. These things have their effect The press in our day is
an estate.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed, I 'm sure of it. There was a cousin of my wife's drew his two
hundred a year out of the 'Tyrawley Express,'&mdash;a daily little paper,
that, maybe, your Lordship never seen.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;When I said an estate, sir, I rather alluded to a recognized condition of
power and influence than to mere wealth. Not, I will add, that I am one of
those who approve of this consummation; nor can I see how men of my order
can ever so regard it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said O'Reilly, sighing, as though the confession cost something,
&ldquo;there 's nothing equal to a newspaper. I 'm reading 'Saunders' this
eight-and-forty years, and I own to you I never found one I liked so much.
For you see, my Lord, it's the same with a paper as with your house,&mdash;you
ought to know where to lay your hand on what you want. Now, you might as
well put me in Buckingham Palace, and tell me to find my bedroom, as give
me the 'Times' and bid me discover the Viceregal Court. If they mention it
at all, it 's among the accidents and offences.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Castle festivities&mdash;Patrick's Hall&mdash;great fun!&rdquo; said Twining,
laughing pleasantly, for he cherished some merry recollections of these
hospitalities.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Have you&mdash;But of course you were too young for presentation,&rdquo; said
his Lordship to Molly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We were n't out; but, in any case, I 'm sure we 'd not have been there,&rdquo;
 said Molly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The pleasure of that presentation may perhaps be reserved for me, who
knows?&rdquo; said the Viscount, graciously. &ldquo;If our people come in, it is the
post they 'd offer me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Lord-Lieutenant!&rdquo; said Molly, opening her eyes to the fullest.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Even so, <i>ma belle</i>. Shall we rehearse the ceremony of presentation?
Twining, do you perform the Chamberlain. Stand aside, O'Reilly; be a
gentleman at large, or an Ulster King-at-arms. Now for it!&rdquo; And so saying,
he drew himself proudly up to an attitude of considerable dignity, while
Twining, muttering to himself, &ldquo;What fun!&rdquo; announced aloud, &ldquo;Miss Molly
O'Reilly, your Excellency;&rdquo; at which, and before she was aware, his
Excellency stepped one step in advance, and sainted her on either cheek
with a cordiality that covered her with blushes.
</p>
<p>
<a name="linkimage-0005" id="linkimage-0005">

</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
<img src="images/10124.jpg" width="100%" alt="124 " />
</div>
<p>
&ldquo;That 's not it, at all, I 'm certain,&rdquo; said she, half angrily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;On my life, it's the exact ceremony, and no more,&rdquo; said the Viscount.
Then resuming the performance, he added, &ldquo;Take care, Twining, that she is
put on your list for the balls. O'Reilly, your niece is charming.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My niece&mdash;sure she 's&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You forget, my worthy friend, that we are enacting Viceroy, and cannot
charge our memory with the ties of kindred.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Spicer now came up to say that a thunderstorm was threatening, and that
the wisest course would probably be to land the luncheon and remain where
they were till the hurricane should pass over. The proposition was at once
approved of, and the party were soon busily occupying themselves in the
cares for the entertainment; all agreeing that they felt no regret at
being separated from the other boat, which had proceeded up the lake; in
fact, as Mr. O'Reilly said, &ldquo;they were snugger as they were, without the
Roosians,&rdquo;&mdash;a sentiment in various ways acknowledged by the rest.
</p>
<p>
Strange freemasonry is there in conviviality. The little preparations for
this picnic dinner disseminated amidst them all the fellowship of old
acquaintance, and, as they assisted and aided each other, a degree of
kindliness grew up that bound them together like a family. Each vied with
each in displaying his power of usefulness and agreeability; even the
noble Viscount, who actually did nothing what-ever, so simulated
occupation and activity that he was regarded by all as the very life and
soul of the party. And yet we are unjust in saying he did nothing; for he
it was who, by the happy charm of his manner, the ready tact of a
consummate man of the world, imparted to the meeting its great success.
Unused to the agreeable qualities of such men, O'Reilly felt all the
astonishment that great conversational gifts inspire, and sat amazed and
delighted at the stores of pleasant stories, witty remarks, and acute
observations poured out before him.
</p>
<p>
He knew nothing of the skill by which these abilities were guided, nor
how, like cunning shopkeepers dressing their wares to most advantage, such
men exhibit their qualities with all the artifice of display. He never
suspected the subtle flattery by which he was led to fancy himself the
intimate of men whose names were freely talked of before him, till at
length the atmosphere of the great world was to him like the air he had
breathed from childhood.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How the Prince would have relished O'Reilly!&rdquo; said the Viscount to
Twining, in a whisper easily overheard. &ldquo;That racy humor, that strong
native common-sense, that vigorous disregard of petty obstacles wherever
he is bent on following out a path,&mdash;his royal Highness would have
appreciated all these.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Unquestionably&mdash;been charmed with them&mdash;thought him most
agreeable&mdash;great fun.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You remind me of O'Kelly,&mdash;Colonel O'Kelly,&mdash;O'Reilly; strange
enough, too, each of you should be of that same old Celtic blood. But,
perhaps, it is just that very element that gives you the peculiar social
fascination I was alluding to. You are not old enough, Twining, to
remember that small house with the bay-windows opening on the Birdcage
Walk; it was like a country parsonage dropped down in the midst of London,
with honeysuckles over the porch, and peacocks on the lawn in front of it.
O'Kelly and Payne lived there together,&mdash;the two pleasantest
bachelors that ever joined in partnership. The Prince dined with them by
agreement every Friday. The charm of the thing was no state, no parade,
whatever. It was just as if O'Reilly here were to take this villa, and
say, 'Now, Lackington, I am rich enough to enjoy myself; I don't want the
worry and fatigue of hunting out the pleasant people of the world; but you
know them all, you understand them,&mdash;their ways, their wants, and
their requirements; just tell me, frankly, could n't we manage to make
this their rallying-spot throughout Europe? Settled down here in the midst
of the most lovely scenery in the world, with a good cook and a good
cellar, might not this place become a perfect Paradise?'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If I only knew that your Lordship, just yourself alone, and, of course,
the present company,&rdquo; added O'Reilly, with a bow round the table, &ldquo;would
vouchsafe me the honor of a visit, I'd be proud to be the owner of this
place to-morrow. Indeed, I don't see why we would n't be as well here as
traipsing over the world in dust and heat. If, then, the girls see no
objection&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I should like it of all things, papa,&rdquo; broke in Miss O'Reilly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am charmed with the very thought of it,&rdquo; cried Molly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Capital thought&mdash;romantic notion&mdash;save any amount of money, and
no taxes,&rdquo; muttered Twining.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There's no approach by land whatever,&rdquo; said Spicer, who foresaw that all
his horse capabilities would receive no development here.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;All the better,&rdquo; broke in Twining; &ldquo;no interlopers&mdash;no fellows
cantering down to luncheon, or driving over to dine&mdash;must come by
boat, and be seen an hour beforehand.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If I know anything of my friend here,&rdquo; said the Viscount, &ldquo;his taste will
rather lie in the fashion of a warm welcome than a polite denial to a
visitor. You must talk to Lanfranchi about the place to-morrow, O'Reilly.
He 's a shrewd fellow, and knows how to go about these things.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faith, my Lord, I see everything in sunshine so long as I sit in such
company. It's the very genial kind of thing I like. A few friends&mdash;if
I 'm not taking too great a liberty&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, by no means, O'Reilly. The esteem I feel for you, and that Twining
feels for you &ldquo;&mdash;here his Lordship looked over at Spicer and slightly
nodded, as though to say, &ldquo;There is another there who requires no formal
mention in the deed &ldquo;&mdash;&ldquo;are not passing sentiments, and we sincerely
desire they may be accepted as true friendship.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure&mdash;unquestionably&mdash;great regard&mdash;unbounded
admiration&mdash;what fun!&rdquo; muttered Twining, half aloud.
</p>
<p>
The evening wore along in pleasant projects for the future. Spicer had
undertaken to provide workmen and artificers of various kinds to repair
and decorate the villa and its grounds. He knew of such a gardener, too;
and he thought, by a little bribery and a trip down to Naples, he might
seduce the Prince of Syracuse's cook,&mdash;a Sicilian, worth all the
Frenchmen in the world for an ultramontane &ldquo;cuisine.&rdquo; In fact, ere the
bright moonlight on the lake reminded them of their journey homeward, they
had arranged a plan of existence for the O'Reillys almost Elysian in its
enjoyments.
</p>
<p>
Few things develop more imaginative powers than the description of a mode
of life wherein &ldquo;money is no object,&rdquo; and wishing and having are
convertible terms. Let a number of people&mdash;the least gifted though
they be with the graces of fancy&mdash;so picture forth such an existence,
and see how, by the mere multiplication of various tastes, they will end
by creating a most voluptuous and splendid tableau. O'Reilly's counsellors
were rather adepts in their way, and certainly they did not forget one
single ingredient of pleasure; till, when the boat glided into the little
bay of the D'Este, such a story of a life was sketched out as nothing out
of fairy-land could rival.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'll have it, my Lord; the place is as good as mine this minute,&rdquo; said
O'Reilly, as he stepped on shore; and as he spoke his heart thrilled with
the concentrated delights of a whole life of happiness.

<h2>
CHAPTER X. A &ldquo;SMALL DINNER&rdquo;
 </h2>
<p>
Lady Lackington and Lady Grace Twining passed the morning together. Their
husbands' departure on the picnic excursion offered them a suitable
subject to discuss those gentlemen, and they improved the occasion to some
purpose.
</p>
<p>
The Viscountess did not, indeed, lean very heavily on her Lord's failings;
they were, as she described them, the harmless follies of certain
middle-aged gentlemen, who, despite time and years, would still be
charming and fascinating. &ldquo;He likes those little easy conquests he is so
sure of amongst vulgar people,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;He affects only to be amused by
them, but he actually likes them; and then, as he never indulges in this
sort of thing except in out-of-the-way places, why, there 's no great harm
in it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Lady Grace agreed with her, and sighed. She sighed, because she thought of
her own burden, and how far more heavily it pressed. Twining's were no
little foibles, no small weaknesses; none of his faults had their root in
any easy self-deceptions. Everything he did or said or thought was
maturely weighed and considered; his gay, laughing manner, his easy,
light-hearted gesticulation, his ready concurrence in the humor about him,
were small coin that he scattered freely while he pondered over heavy
investments.
</p>
<p>
From long experience of his crafty, double-dealing nature, coupled with
something very near aversion to him, Lady Grace had grown to believe that
in all he said or did some unseen motive lay, and she brought herself to
believe that even his avaricious and miserly habits were practised still
less for the sake of saving than for some ulterior and secret end.
</p>
<p>
Of the wretched life they led she drew a dreary picture: a mock splendor
for the world, a real misery at home; all the outward semblance of costly
living, all the internal consciousness of meanness and privation. He
furnished houses with magnificence, that he might let them; he set up
splendid equipages, that, when seen, they should be sold. &ldquo;My very
emeralds,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;were admired and bought by the Duchess of
Windermere. It is very difficult to say that there is anything out of
which he cannot extract a profit. If my ponies were praised in the park, I
knew it was only the prelude to their being at Tattersall's in the
morning; even the camellia which I wore in my hair was turned to
advantage, for it sold the conservatory that raised it. And yet they tell
me that if&mdash;they say that&mdash;I mean&mdash;I am told that the law
would not construe these as cruelty, but simply a very ordinary exercise
of marital authority, something unpleasant, perhaps, but not enough to
warrant complaint, still less resistance.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But they <i>are</i> cruelties,&rdquo; broke in Lady Lackington; &ldquo;men in Mr.
Twining's rank of life do not beat their wives&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, they only break their hearts,&rdquo; sighed Lady Grace; &ldquo;and this, I
believe, is perfectly legal.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They were doing, or going to do, something about that t' other day in the
Lords. That dear old man, Lord Cloudeslie, had a bill or an amendment to
somebody's bill, by which&mdash;I 'm not sure I 'm quite correct about it&mdash;but
I believe it gave the wife power to take her settlement. No, that is not
it; she was to be able, after five years of great cruelty&mdash;I'm afraid
I have no clear recollection of its provisions, but I know the odious
Chancellor said it would effectually make women independent of men.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course it never will become law, then,&rdquo; sighed Lady Grace, again.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who knows, dear? They are always passing something or other they 're
sorry for afterwards in either House. Shall I tell you who'd know all
about it?&mdash;that Mr. Davenport Dunn. He is just the kind of person to
understand these things.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Grace, with more animation in her manner.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let as ask him to dinner,&rdquo; said Lady Lackington; &ldquo;I know him sufficiently
to do so,&mdash;that is, I have met him once. He 'll be charmed, of
course; and if there is anything very good and very safe to be done on the
Bourse, he 'll certainly tell us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don't care for the Bourse. Indeed, I have nothing to speculate with.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That is the best reason in the world, my dear, to make a venture; at
least, so my brother-in-law, Annesley, says. You are certain to come out a
winner, and in my own brief experiences, I never gave anything,&mdash;I
only said, 'Yes, I 'll have the shares.' They were at fifty-eight and
three-quarters, they said, and sure to be at sixty-four or five; and they
actually did rise to seventy, and then we sold&mdash;that is, Dunn did&mdash;and
remitted me twelve hundred and fifty-three pounds odd.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wish he could be equally fortunate with me. I don't mean as regards
money,&rdquo; said Lady Grace; and her cheek became crimson as she spoke.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have always said there's a fate in these things; and who knows if his
being here Just at this moment is not a piece of destiny.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It might be so,&rdquo; said the other, sadly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Lady Lackington, as she rapidly wrote a few lines on a piece
of note-paper, &ldquo;that ought to do:&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;'Dear Mr. Dunn,&mdash;If you will accept of an early dinner,
with Lady Grace Twining and myself for the company, to-day,
you will much oblige

&ldquo;'Your truly,

&ldquo;'Georgina Lackington.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
&ldquo;To another kind of man I'd have said something about two <i>pauvres
femmes délaissées</i>, but he 'd have been frightened, and probably not
come.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; said Lady Grace, with a sigh.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now, let us try the success of this.&rdquo; And she rang a bell, and despatched
the note.
</p>
<p>
Lady Lackington had scarcely time to deliver a short essay on the class
and order of men to which Mr. Davenport Dunn pertained, when the servant
returned with the answer. It was a very formal acceptance of the
invitation, &ldquo;Mr. Davenport Dunn presented his compliments,&rdquo;&mdash;and so
on.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course, he comes,&rdquo; said she, throwing the note away. &ldquo;Do you know, my
dear, I half suspect we have been indiscreet; for now that we have caught
our elephant, what shall we do with him?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I cannot give you one solitary suggestion.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;These people are not our people, nor are their gods our gods,&rdquo; said Lady
Lackington.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If we all offer up worship at the same temple,&mdash;the Bourse,&rdquo; said
Lady Grace, something sadly,&mdash;&ldquo;we can scarcely dispute about a
creed.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That is only true in a certain sense,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;Money is a
necessity to all; the means of obtaining it may, therefore, be common to
many. It is in the employment of wealth, in the tasteful expenditure of
riches, that we distinguish ourselves from these people. You have only to
see the houses they keep, their plate, their liveries, their equipages,
and you perceive at once that whenever they rise above some grovelling
imitation they commit the most absurd blunders against all taste and
propriety. I wish we had Spicer here to see about this dinner, it is one
of the very few things he understands; but I suppose we must leave it to
the cook himself, and we have the comfort of knowing that the criticism on
his efforts will not be of a very high order.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We dine at four, I believe,&rdquo; said Lady Grace, in her habitual tone of
sorrow, as she swept from the room with that gesture of profound woe that
would have graced a queen in tragedy.
</p>
<p>
Let us turn for a moment to Mr. Davenport Dunn. Lady Lackington's
invitation had not produced in him either those overwhelming sensations of
astonishment or those excessive emotions of delight which she had so
sanguinely calculated on. There was a time that a Viscountess asking him
thus to dinner had been an event, the very fact being one requiring some
effort on his part to believe; but these days were long past. Mr. Dunn had
not only dined with great people since that, but had himself been their
host and entertainer. Noble lords and baronets had sipped his claret,
right honorables praised his sherry, and high dignitaries condescended to
inquire where he got &ldquo;that exquisite port.&rdquo; The tremulous, faint-hearted,
doubting spirit, the suspectful, self-distrusting, humble man, had gone,
and in his place there was a bold, resolute nature, confident and able,
daily testing his strength against some other in the ring, and as often
issuing from the contest satisfied that he had little to fear from any
antagonist. He was clever enough to see that the great objects in life are
accomplished less by dexterity and address than by a strong, undeviating
purpose. The failure of many a gifted man, and the high success of many a
commonplace one, had not been without its lesson for him; and it was in
the firm resolve to rise a winner that he sat down to the game of life.
</p>
<p>
Lady Lackington's invitation was, therefore, neither a cause of pleasure
nor astonishment. He remembered having met her somewhere, some time, and
he approached the renewed acquaintance without any one of the sentiments
her Ladyship had so confidently predicted. Indeed, so little of that
flurry of anticipation did he experience, that he had to be reminded her
Ladyship was waiting dinner for him, before he could remember the pleasure
that was before him.
</p>
<p>
It may be a very ungallant confession for this true history to make, but
we cannot blink saying that Lady Lack-ington and Lady Grace both evidenced
by their toilette that they were not indifferent to the impression they
were to produce upon their guest.
</p>
<p>
The Viscountess was dressed in the perfection of that French taste whose
chief characteristic is freshness and elegance. She was light, gauzy, and
floating,&mdash;a sweeping something of Valenciennes and white muslin,&mdash;but
yet human withal, and very graceful. Her friend, in deep black, with a
rich lace veil fastened on her head behind, and draped artistically over
one shoulder, was a charming personification of affliction not beyond
consolation. When they met, it was with an exchange of looks that said,
&ldquo;This ought to do.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Lady Lackington debated with herself what precise manner of reception she
would award to Mr. Dunn,&mdash;whether to impose by the haughty
condescension of a fine lady, or fascinate by the graceful charm of an
agreeable one. She was &ldquo;equal to either fortune,&rdquo; and could calculate on
success, whichever road she adopted. While she thus hesitated, he entered.
</p>
<p>
If his approach had little or nothing of the man of fashion about it, it
was still a manner wherein there was little to criticise. It was not bold
nor timid, and, without anything like over-confidence, there was yet an
air of self-reliance that was not without dignity.
</p>
<p>
At dinner the conversation ranged over the usual topics of foreign travel,
foreign habits, collections, and galleries. Of pictures and statues he had
seen much, and evidently with profit and advantage; of people and society
he knew next to nothing, and her Ladyship quickly detected this
deficiency, and fell back upon it as her stronghold.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;When hard-worked men like myself take a holiday,&rdquo; said Dunn, &ldquo;they are
but too glad to escape from the realities of life by taking refuge amongst
works of art. The painter and the sculptor suggest as much poetry as can
consist with their stern notions, and are always real enough to satisfy
the demand for fact.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But would not what you call your holiday be more pleasantly passed in
making acquaintances? You could of course have easy access to the most
distinguished society.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm a bad Frenchman, my Lady, and speak not a word of German or Italian.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;English is very generally cultivated just now,&mdash;the persons best
worth talking to can speak it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The restraint of a strange tongue, like the novelty of a court dress, is
a sad detractor from all naturalness. At least, in my own little
experience with strangers, I have failed to read anything of a man's
character when he addressed me in a language not his own.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And was it essential you should have read it?&rdquo; asked Lady Grace,
languidly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am always more at my ease when I know the geography of the land I live
in,&rdquo; said Dunn, smiling.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I should say you have great gifts in that way,&mdash;I mean in
deciphering character,&rdquo; said Lady Lackington.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your Ladyship flatters me. I have no pretensions of the kind. Once
satisfied of the sincerity of those with whom I come into contact, I never
strive to know more, nor have I the faculties to attempt more.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But, in your wide-spread intercourse with life, do you not, insensibly as
it were, become an adept in reading men's natures?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don't think so, my Lady. The more one sees of life the simpler does it
seem, not from any study of humanity, but by the easy fact that three or
four motives sway the whole world. An unsupplied want of one kind or other&mdash;wealth,
rank, distinction, affection, it may be&mdash;gives the entire impulse to
a character, just as a passion imparts the expression to a face; and all
the diversities of temperament, like those of countenance, are nothing but
the impress of a want,&mdash;you may call it a wish. Now it may be,&rdquo; added
he, and as he spoke he stole a glance, quick as lightning, at Lady Grace,
&ldquo;that such experiences are more common to men like myself,&mdash;men, I
mean, who are intrusted with the charge of others' interests; but
assuredly I have no clew to character save in that one feature,&mdash;a
want.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I want fifty thousand things,&rdquo; said Lady Lacking-ton. &ldquo;I want a deal
of money; I want that beautiful villa near Palermo, the 'Serra Novena;' I
want that Arab pony Kratuloff rides in the park; I want, in short,
everything that pleases me every hour of the day.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;These are not wants that make impulses, no more than a passing shower
makes a climate,&rdquo; said Dunn. &ldquo;What I speak of is that unceasing, unwearied
desire that is with us in joy or sadness, that journeys with us and lives
with us, mingling in every action, blending with every thought, and
presenting to our minds a constant picture of ourselves under some
wished-for aspect different from all we have ever known, where we are
surrounded with other impulses and swayed by other passions, and yet still
identically ourselves. Lady Grace apprehends me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps,&mdash;at least partly,&rdquo; said she, fanning herself and concealing
her face.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There are very few exempt from a temptation of this sort, or, if they be,
it is because their minds are dissipated on various objects.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I hate things to be called temptations, and snares, and the rest of it,&rdquo;
 said Lady Lackington; &ldquo;it is a very tiresome cant. You may tell me while I
am waiting for my fish-sauce at dinner, it is a temptation; but if you
wish me really to understand the word, tell me of some wonderful
speculation, some marvellous scheme for securing millions. Oh, dear Mr.
Dunn, you who really know the way, will you just show me the road to&mdash;I
will be moderate&mdash;about twenty thousand pounds?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nothing easier, my Lady, if you are disposed to risk forty.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I am not, sir. I have not the slightest intention to risk one
hundred. I 'm not a gambler.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And yet what your Ladyship points at is very like gambling.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pray place that word along with temptation, in the forbidden category; it
is quite hateful to me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Have <i>you</i> the same dislike to chance, Lady Grace?&rdquo; said he,
stealing a look at her face with some earnestness.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she, in a low voice; &ldquo;it is all I have to look for.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;By the way, Mr. Dunn, what are they doing in Parliament about us? Is
there not something contemplated by which we can insist upon separate
maintenance, or having a suitable settlement, or&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Separation&mdash;divorce,&rdquo; said Lady Grace, solemnly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, my Lady, the law is only repairing an old road, not making a new one.
The want of the age is cheapness,&mdash;cheap literature, cheap postage,
and cheap travelling, and why not cheap divorce? Legislation now professes
as its great aim to extend to the poor all the comforts of the rich; and
as this is supposed to be one of them&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Have you any reason to doubt it, sir?&rdquo; asked Lady Grace.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Luxuries cease to be luxuries when they become common. Cheap divorce will
be as unfashionable as cheap pine-apple when a coal-heaver can have it,&rdquo;
 said Lady Lackington.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You mistake, it seems to me, what constitutes the luxury,&rdquo; interposed
Lady Grace. &ldquo;Every day of the year sees men liberated from prison, yet no
one will pretend that the sense of freedom is less dear to every creature
thus delivered.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your figure is but too like,&rdquo; said Dunn. &ldquo;The divorced wife will be to
the world only too much a resemblance of the liberated prisoner. Dark or
fair, guilty or innocent, she will carry with her the opprobrium of a
public trial, a discussion, and a verdict. Now, how few of us would go
through an operation in public for the cure of a malady! Would we not
rather hug our sorrows and our sufferings in secrecy than accept health on
such conditions?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not when the disease was consuming your very vitals,&mdash;not when a
perpetual fever racked your brain and boiled in your blood. You'd take
little heed of what is called exposure then. The cry of your heart would
be, 'Save me! save me!'&rdquo; As she spoke, her voice grew louder and wilder,
till it became almost a shriek, and, as she ended, she lay back, flushed
and panting, in her chair.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have made her quite nervous, Mr. Dunn,&rdquo; said Lady Lackington, as she
arose and fanned her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, no. It's nothing. Just let me have a little fresh air,&mdash;on the
terrace. Will you give me your arm?&rdquo; said Lady Grace, faintly. And Dunn
assisted her as she arose and walked out. &ldquo;How very delicious this is!&rdquo;
 said she, as she leaned over the balcony, and gazed down upon the placid
water, streaked with long lines of starlight. &ldquo;I conclude,&rdquo; said she,
after a little pause, &ldquo;that scenes like this&mdash;moments as peacefully
tranquil&mdash;are as dear to you, hard-worked men of the world, as they
are to the wearied hearts of us poor women, all whose ambitions are so
humble in comparison.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We are all of us striving for the same goal, I believe,&rdquo; said he,&mdash;&ldquo;this
same search after happiness, the source of so much misery!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are not married, I believe?&rdquo; said she, in an accent whose very
softness had a tone of friendship.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; I am as much alone in the world as one well can be,&rdquo; rejoined he,
sorrowfully.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And have you gone through life without ever meeting one with whom you
would have been content to make partnership,&mdash;taking her, as those
solemn words say, 'for better, for worse'?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They are solemn words,&rdquo; said he, evading her question; &ldquo;for they pledge
that for which it is so hard to promise,&mdash;the changeful moods which
time and years bring over us. Which of us at twenty can say what he will
be at thirty,&mdash;still less at fifty? The world makes us many things we
never meant to be.&rdquo;

</div>
<p>
&ldquo;So, then, you are not happy?&rdquo; said she, in the same low voice.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have not said so much,&rdquo; said he, smiling sadly; &ldquo;are you?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Can you ask me? Is not the very confidence wherewith I treat you&mdash;strangers
as we were an hour back to each other&mdash;the best evidence that it is
from the very depth of my misery I appeal to you?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Make no rash confidences, Lady Grace,&rdquo; said he, seriously. &ldquo;They who tell
of their heart's sorrows to the world are like those who count their gold
before robbers. I have seen a great deal of life, and the best philosophy
I have learned from it is to 'bear.' Bear everything that can be borne.
You will be surprised what a load you will carry by mere practice of
endurance.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is so easy to say to one in pain, 'Have patience,'&rdquo; said she,
bitterly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have practised what I teach for many a year. Be assured of one thing,&mdash;the
Battle of Life is waged by all. The most favored by fortune&mdash;the
luckiest, as the world calls them&mdash;have their contest and their
struggle. It is not for existence, but it is often for what makes
existence valuable.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She sighed deeply, and, after a pause, he went on,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We pity the poor, weary, heart-sick litigant, wearing out life in the
dreary prosecution of a Chancery suit, dreaming at night of that fortune
he is never to see, and waking every day to the same dull round of
pursuit. As hope flickers in his heart, suffering grows a habit; his whole
nature imbibes the conflicting character of his cause; he doubts and
hesitates and hopes and fears and wishes, till his life is one long fever.
But infinitely more painful is the struggle of the heart whose affections
have been misplaced. These are the suits over which no hope ever throws a
ray. It is a long, dreary path, without a halting-place or a goal.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
As he spoke, she covered her face with her handkerchief; but he could
perceive that she was weeping.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am speaking of what I know,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I remember once coming closely
into relations with a young nobleman whose station, fortune, and personal
advantages combined to realize all that one could fancy of worldly
blessings. He was just one of those types a novelist would take to
represent the most favored class of the most favored land of Europe. He
had an ancient name, illustrious in various ways, a splendid fortune, was
singularly endowed with abilities, highly accomplished, and handsome, and,
more than all, he was gifted with that mysterious power of fascination by
which some men contrive to make themselves so appreciated by others that
their influence is a sort of magic. Give him an incident to relate,&mdash;let
him have a passing event to tell, wherein some emotion of pity, some
sentiment of devotion played a part,&mdash;and without the slightest touch
of artifice, without the veriest shade of ingenuity, he could make you
listen breathlessly, and hang in rapture on his words. Well, this man&mdash;of
whom, if I suffer myself to speak, I shall grow wearisome in the praise&mdash;this
man was heart-broken. Before he succeeded to his title, he was very poor,
a subaltern in the army, with little beyond his pay. He fell in love with
a very beautiful girl&mdash;I never heard her name, but I know that she
was a daughter of one of the first houses in England. She returned his
affection, and there was one of those thousand cases wherein love has to
combat all the odds, and devotion subdue every thought that appeals to
worldly pride and vanity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;She accepted the contest nobly; she was satisfied to brave humble
fortune, obscurity, exile,&mdash;everything for him&mdash;at least she
said so, and I believe she thought she could keep her word. When the
engagement took place&mdash;which was a secret to their families&mdash;the
London season had just begun.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is not for me to tell you what a period of intoxicating pleasure and
excitement that is, nor how in that wondrous conflict of wealth, splendor,
beauty, and talent, all the fascination of gambling is imparted to a scene
where, of necessity, gain and loss are alternating. It demands no common
power of head and heart to resist these temptations. Apparently she had
not this self-control. The gorgeous festivities about her, the splendor of
wealth, and more than even that, the esteem in which it was held, struck
her forcibly. She saw that the virtues of humble station met no more
recognition than the false lustre of mock gems,&mdash;that ordinary gifts,
illustrated by riches, became actual graces. She could not shut out the
contrast between her lover, poor, unnoticed, and unregarded, and the crowd
of fashionable and distinguished youths whose princely fortunes gave them
place and pre-eminence. In fact, as he himself told me,&mdash;for
Allington excused her&mdash;Good Heavens! are you ill?&rdquo; cried be, as with
a low, faint cry she sank to the ground.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is she dying? Good God! is she dead?&rdquo; cried Lady Lackington, as she
lifted the powerless arm, and held the cold hands within her own.
</p>
<p>
Lanfranchi was speedily sent for, and saw that it was merely a fainting
fit.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;She was quite well previously, was she not?&rdquo; asked he of Dunn.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Perfectly so. We were chatting of indifferent matters,&mdash;of London,
and the season,&mdash;when she was seized,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Is there anything in
the air here that disposes to these attacks?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Lanfranchi looked at him without reply. Possibly they understood each
other, for they parted without further colloquy.

<h2>
CHAPTER XI. &ldquo;A CONSULTATION.&rdquo;
 </h2>
<p>
It was late in the night as Lord Lackington and his friends reached the
villa, a good deal wearied, very jaded, and, if the confession may be
made, a little sick of each other; they parted pretty much as the members
of such day-long excursions are wont to do,&mdash;not at all sorry to have
reached home again, and brought their trip of pleasure to an end. Twining,
of course, was the same happy-natured, gay, volatile creature that he set
out in the morning. Everything went well with him, the world had but one
aspect, which was a pleasant one, and he laughed and muttered, &ldquo;What fun!&rdquo;
 as in half-dogged silence the party wended their way through the garden
towards the house.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I hope these little girls may not have caught cold,&rdquo; said the Viscount,
as he stood with Twining on the terrace, after saying &ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I hope so, with all my heart. Charming girls&mdash;most fascinating&mdash;father
so amiable.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Isn't that Dunn's apartment we see the light in?&rdquo; asked the other, half
impatiently. &ldquo;I 'll go and make him a visit.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Overjoyed to see you, greatly flattered by the attention,&rdquo; chimed in
Twining; and while he rubbed his hands over the enchanting prospect, Lord
Lackington walked away.
</p>
<p>
Not waiting for any announcement, and turning the handle of the door
immediately after he had knocked at it, the Viscount entered. Whether Dunn
had heard him or not, he never stirred from the table where he was
writing, but continued engrossed by his occupation till his Lordship
accosted him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have come to disturb you, I fear, Dunn?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh! Lord Lackington, your most obedient. Too happy to be honored by your
presence at any time. Just returned, I conclude?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, only this moment,&rdquo; said the Viscount, sighing weariedly. &ldquo;These
picnics are stupid inventions; they fatigue and they exhaust. They give
little pleasure at the time, and none whatever to look back upon.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your Lordship's picture is rather a dreary one,&rdquo; said Dunn, smiling.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Perfectly correct, I assure you; I went simply to oblige some country
folks of yours. The O'Reillys,&mdash;nice little girls,&mdash;very
natural, very pretty creatures; but the thing is a bore. I never knew any
one who enjoyed it except the gentleman who gets tipsy, and <i>he</i> has
an awful retribution in the next day's headache,&mdash;the terrible
headache of iced rum punch.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Dunn laughed, because he saw that his Lordship expected as much; and the
Viscount resumed,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am vexed, besides, at the loss of time; I wanted to have my morning
with <i>you</i> here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Dunn bowed graciously, but did not speak.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We have so much to talk over&mdash;so many things to arrange&mdash;that I
am quite provoked at having thrown away a day; and you, too, are possibly
pressed for time?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He nodded in assent.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You can give me to-morrow, however?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I can give you to-night, my Lord, which will, perhaps, do as well.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But to-morrow&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, to-morrow, my Lord, I start with Baron Glumthal for Frankfort, to
meet the Elector of Darmstadt,&mdash;an appointment that cannot be
broken.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Politically most important, I have no doubt,&rdquo; said the Viscount, with an
undisguised sarcasm in the tone.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, my Lord, a mere financial affair,&rdquo; said Dunn, not heeding the other's
manner. &ldquo;His Highness wants a loan, and we are willing to accommodate
him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wish I could find you in the same liberal spirit. It is the very thing
I stand in need of Just now. In fact, Dunn, you must do it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The half-coaxing accent of these last words was a strong contrast to the
sneer of a few seconds before, and Dunn smiled as he heard them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I fancy, my Lord, that if you are still of the same mind as before, you
will have little occasion to arrange for a loan in any quarter.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pooh! pooh! the scheme is absurd. It has not one, but fifty obstacles
against it. In the first place, you know nothing of this fellow, or
whether he can be treated with. As for myself, I do not believe one word
about his claim. Why, sir, there's not a titled house in England has not
at some period or other been assailed with this sort of menace. It is the
stalest piece of knavery going. If you were to poll the peers to-morrow,
you 'd not meet two out of ten have not been served with notice of action,
or ejectment on the title; in fact, sir, these suits are a profession, and
a very lucrative one, too.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Lord Lackington spoke warmly, and ere he had finished had lashed himself
up into a passion. Meanwhile Duun sat patiently, like one who awaited the
storm to pass by ere he advanced upon his road.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I conclude, from your manner, that you do not agree with me?&rdquo; said the
Viscount.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your Lordship opines truly. I take a very different view of this
transaction. I have had all the documents of Conway's claim before me. Far
more competent judges have seen and pronounced upon them. They constitute
a most formidable mass of evidence, and, save in a very few and not very
important details, present an unbroken chain of testimony.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So, then, there is a battery preparing to open fire upon us?&rdquo; said the
Viscount, with a laugh of ill-affected indifference.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is a mine whose explosion depends entirely upon your Lordship's
discretion. If I say, my Lord, that I never perused a stronger case, I
will also say that I never heard of one so easy of management The
individual in whose favor these proofs exist has not the slightest
knowledge of them. He has not a suspicion that all his worldly prospects
put together are worth a ten-pound note. It is only within the last three
months that I have succeeded in even discovering where he is.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And where is he?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Serving as a soldier with his regiment in the Crimea. He was in hospital
at Scutari when I first heard, but since that returned to duty with his
regiment.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What signifies all this? The fellow himself is nothing to us!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Dunn again waited till this burst of anger had passed, and then resumed,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My Lord, understand me well. You can deal with this case now; six months
hence it may be clear and clean beyond all your power of interference. If
Conway's claim derive, as I have strong ground to believe it, from the
elder branch, the estate and the title are both his.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are a hardy fellow, a very hardy fellow, Mr. Dunn, to make such a
speech as this!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I said, 'If,' my Lord&mdash;'If' is everything here. The assumption is
that Reginald Conway was summoned by mistake to the House of Peers in
Henry the Seventh's reign,&mdash;the true Baron Lackington being then an
exile. It is from him this Conway's descent claims.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm not going to constitute myself a Committee of Privileges, sir, and
listen to all this jargon; nor can I easily conceive that the unshaken
possession of centuries is to be disturbed by the romantic pretensions of
a Crimean soldier. I am also aware how men of your cloth conduct these
affair to their own especial advantage. They assume to be the arbiters of
the destinies of great families, and they expect to be paid for their
labors,&mdash;eh, is n't it so?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I believe your Lordship has very accurately defined our position, though,
perhaps, we might not quite agree as to the character of the
remuneration.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How so? What do you mean?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I, for instance, my Lord, would furnish no bill of costs to either party.
My relations with your Lordship are such as naturally give me a very deep
interest in what concerns you; of Mr. Conway I know nothing.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So, then, you are simply moved in this present affair by a principle of
pure benevolence; you are to be a sort of providence to the House of
Lackington,&mdash;eh, is that it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your Lordship's explanation is most gracious,&rdquo; said Dunn, bowing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come, now; let us talk seriously,&rdquo; said the Viscount, in a changed tone.
&ldquo;What is it you propose?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What I would <i>suggest</i>, my Lord,&rdquo; said Dunn, with a marked emphasis
on the word, &ldquo;is this. Submit the documents of this claim&mdash;we can
obtain copies of the most important of them&mdash;to competent opinion,
learn if they be of the value I attribute to them, see, in fact, if this
claim be prosecuted, whether it is likely to succeed at law, and, if so,
anticipate the issue by a compromise.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But what compromise?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your Lordship has no heir. Your brother, who stands next in succession,
need not marry. This point at once decided, Conway's claim can take its
course after Mr. Beecher's demise. The estates secured to your Lordship
for life will amply guarantee a loan to the extent you wish.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But they are mine, sir; they are mine this moment. I can go into the
market to-morrow and raise what amount I please&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Take care, my Lord, take care; a single imprudent step might spoil all.
If you were to negotiate a mere ten thousand to-morrow, you might be met
by the announcement that your whole property was about to be litigated,
and your title to it contested. Too late to talk of compromise, then.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;This sounds very like a threat, Mr. Dunn.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then have I expressed myself most faultily, my Lord; nor was there
anything less near my thoughts.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Would you like to see my brother? He shall call on you in Dublin; you
will be there by&mdash;when?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Wednesday week, my Lord; and it is a visit would give me much pleasure.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If I were to tell you my mind frankly, Dunn,&rdquo; said the Viscount, in a
more assured tone, &ldquo;I 'd say, I would not give a ten-pound note to buy up
this man's whole claim. Annesley, however, has a right to be consulted; he
has an interest only second to my own. See him, talk it over with him, and
write, to me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where shall I address you, my Lord?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Florence; I shall leave this at once,&mdash;to-night,&rdquo; said Lord
Lackington, impatiently; for, somehow,&mdash;we are not going to
investigate wherefore,&mdash;he was impatient to be off, and see no more
of those he had been so intimate with.

<h2>
CHAPTER XII. ANNESLEY BEECHER'S &ldquo;PAL&rdquo;
 </h2>
<p>
Lord Lackington was not much of a letter-writer; correspondence was not
amongst the habits of his day. The society in which he moved, and of
which, to some extent, he was a type, cared more for conversational than
epistolary graces. They kept their good things for their dinner-parties,
and hoarded their smart remarks on life for occasions where the success
was a personal triumph. Twice or thrice, however, every year, he was
obliged to write. His man of business required to be reminded of this or
that necessity for money, and his brother Annesley should also be
admonished, or reproved, or remonstrated with, in that tone of superiority
and influence so well befitting one who pays an annuity to him who is the
recipient. In fact, around this one circumstance were grouped all the
fraternal feelings and brotherly interest of these two men. One hundred
and twenty-five pounds sterling every half-year represented the ties of
blood that united them; and while it offered to the donor the proud
reflection of a generous self-sacrifice, it gave to him who received the
almost as agreeable occasion for sarcastic allusion to the other's miserly
habits and sordid nature, with a contrast of what he himself had done were
their places in life reversed.
</p>
<p>
It was strange enough that the one same incident should have begotten such
very opposite emotions; and yet the two phrases, &ldquo;If you knew all I have
done for him,&rdquo; and the rejoinder, &ldquo;You 'd not believe the beggarly
pittance he allows me,&rdquo; were correct exponents of their several feelings.
</p>
<p>
Not impossible is it that each might have made out a good case against the
other. Indeed, it was a theme whereon, in their several spheres, they were
eloquent; and few admitted to the confidence of either had not heard of
the utter impossibility of doing anything for Annesley,&mdash;his reckless
folly, his profligacy, and his waste; and, on the other hand, &ldquo;the
incredible meanness of Lackington, with at least twelve thousand a year,
and no children to provide for, giving me the salary of an upper butler.&rdquo;
 Each said far too much in his own praise not to have felt, at least,
strong misgivings in his conscience. Each knew far too well that the other
had good reason in many things he said; but so long had their
plausibilities been repeated, that each ended by satisfying himself he was
a paragon of fraternal affection, and, stranger still, had obtained for
this opinion a distinct credence in their several sets in society; so that
every peer praised the Viscount, and every hard-up younger son pitied poor
Annesley, and condemned the &ldquo;infamous conduct of the old coxcomb his
brother.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That scampish fellow's conduct is killing poor Lackington,&rdquo; would say a
noble lord.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Annesley can't stand old Lackington's treatment much longer,&rdquo; was the
commentary of half-pay captains of dragoons.
</p>
<p>
Had you but listened to Lord Lackington, he would have told you of at
least fifty distinct schemes he had contrived for his brother's worldly
success, all marred and spoiled by that confounded recklessness, &ldquo;that
utter disregard, sir, of the commonest rules of conduct that every man in
life is bound to observe.&rdquo; He might have been, by this time, colonel of
the Fifty-something; he might have been governor of some fortunate island
in the Pacific; consul-general at Sunstroke Town, in Africa, where, after
three years, you retire with a full pension. If he 'd have gone into the
Church,&mdash;and there was no reason why he should n't,&mdash;there was
the living of St. Cuthbert-in-the-Vale, eight hundred a year, ready for
him. Every Administration for years back had been entreated in his favor;
and from Ordnance clerkships to Commissions in Lunacy he had been offered
places in abundance. Sinecures in India and jobs in Ireland had been found
out in his behalf, and deputy-somethings created in Bermuda just to
provide for him.
</p>
<p>
The concessions he had made, the proxies he had given, &ldquo;just for
Annesley's sake,&rdquo; formed a serious charge against the noble Lord's
political consistency; and he quoted them as the most stunning evidences
of fraternal love, and pointed out where he had gone against his
conscience and his party as to a kind of martyrdom that made a man
illustrious forever.
</p>
<p>
As for Annesley, his indictment had, to the full, as many counts. What he
might have been,&mdash;not in a mere worldly sense, not as regards place,
pension, or emolument, but what in integrity, what in fair fame, what in
honorable conduct and unblemished character, if Lackington had only dealt
fairly with him,&mdash;&ldquo;there was really no saying.&rdquo; The noble motives
which might have prompted, the high aspirations that might have moved him,
all the generous impulses of a splendid nature were there, thwarted,
baffled, and destroyed by Lackington's confounded stupidity. What the
Viscount ought to have done, what precise species of culture he should
have devoted to these budding virtues, how he ought to have trained and
trellised these tender shoots of aspiring goodness, he never exactly
detailed. It was only clear that, whatever the road, he had never taken
it; and it was really heart-breaking to hear what the world had lost in
public and private virtues, all for Lackington's indolence and folly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He never gave me a chance, sir,&mdash;not one chance,&rdquo; would he say.
&ldquo;Why, he knows Palmerston just as well as I know you; he can talk to Lord
Derby as freely as I am speaking at this minute; and, would you believe
it? he wouldn't say, 'There's Annesley&mdash;my brother Annesley&mdash;wants
that commissionership or that secretary's place. Annesley 's a devilish
clever fellow,&mdash;up to a thing or two,&mdash;ask Grog Davis if he
ain't. Just try to get between him and the ropes, that's all; see if he
does n't sleep with one eye open. 'Do you tell me there's one of them
would refuse him? Grog said to his face, at Epsom Downs, the morning
Crocus was scratched, 'My Lord,' says he, 'take all you can get upon
Annesley; make your book on him; he's the best horse in your lot, and it's
Grog Davis says it.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Very true was it that Grog Davis said so. Nay, to enjoy the pleasure of
hearing him so discourse was about the greatest gratification of Annesley
Beecher's present life. He was poor and discredited. The Turf Club would
not have him; he durst not show at Tattersall's. Few would dine, none
discount him; and yet that one man's estimate of his gifts sustained him
through all. &ldquo;If Grog be right&mdash;and he ought to be, seeing that a
more dodgy, crafty fellow never lived&mdash;I shall come all round again.
He that never backed the wrong horse could n't be far astray about men. He
thinks I've running in me yet; <i>he</i> sees that I 'll come out one of
these days in top condition, and show my number from the stand-house.&rdquo; To
have had the greatest opinion in Equity favorable to your cause in
Chancery, to have known that Thesiger or Kelly said your case was safe, to
learn that Faraday had pronounced your analysis correct, or White, of
Cowes, had approved of the lines of your new yacht,&mdash;would any of
them be very reassuring sensations; and yet were they as nothing to the
unbounded confidence imparted to Beecher's mind by the encouraging opinion
of his friend Grog Davis. It is only justice to say that Beecher's
estimate of Davis was a feeling totally free of all the base alloy of any
self-interest. With all Grog's great abilities, with talents of the very
highest order, he was the reverse of a successful man. Trainer,
auctioneer, sporting character, pugilist, publican, and hell-keeper, he
had been always unlucky. He had his share of good things,&mdash;more than
his share. He had been in at some of the &ldquo;very best-robberies&rdquo; ever done
at Newmarket. The horses he had &ldquo;nobbled,&rdquo; the jockeys &ldquo;squared,&rdquo; the
owners &ldquo;hocussed,&rdquo; were legion. All the matches he had &ldquo;made safe,&rdquo; all
the fights he had sold, would have filled five columns of &ldquo;Bell's Life.&rdquo;
 In whatever called itself &ldquo;sport&rdquo; he had dabbled and cheated for years;
and yet, there he was, with all his successes and all his experiences,
something more than fifteen thousand pounds worse than ruined.
</p>
<p>
Worthy reader, have you stood by while some enthusiastic admirer of
Turner's later works has, in all the fervor of his zeal, encomiumized one
of those strange, incomprehensible creations, where cloud and sea,
atmosphere, shadow and smoke, seem madly commingled with tall masts
piercing the lurid vapor, and storm-clouds drifting across ruined towers?
If at first you gladly welcomed any guidance through the wondrous
labyrinth, and you accepted gratefully the aid of one who could reconcile
seeming incongruities, and explain apparent difficulties, what was your
disappointment, at last, to discover that from some defect of
organization, some absent power of judgment, you could not follow the
elucidation; that you saw no power in this, no poetry in that; that no
light gleamed into <i>your</i> soul out of all that darkness, nor any hope
into <i>your</i> heart, from the mad confusion of that chaos? Pretty much
the same mystification had it been to you to have listened to Annes-ley
Beecher's account of his friend Grog Davis. It was evident that <i>he</i>
saw the reason for everything,&mdash;he could account for all; but, alas!
the explanatory gift was denied him. The very utmost you could attain to
was a glimmering perception that there were several young men of rank and
station who had only half trusted the distinguished Davis, and in their
sparing confidence had rescued themselves from his knavery; that very
artful combinations occasionally require confederates, and confederates
are not always loyal; that Grog occasionally did things with too high a
hand,&mdash;in plain words, reserved for himself more than his share of
the booty; and, in fact, that, with the best intentions and the most
decided determination to put others &ldquo;into the hole,&rdquo; he fell in himself,
and so completely, too, that he had never been able to show his head out
of it ever since.
</p>
<p>
If, therefore, as we have said, Annesley Beecher's explanation of these
tangled skeins was none of the clearest, there was nothing daunting to
himself in that difficulty. On the contrary, he deemed his intimacy with
Grog as one of his greatest privileges. Grog had told him things that he
would not tell to another man breathing; he had seen, in Grog's own hand,
what would, if not hang him, give him twenty years at Norfolk Island; he
knew that Grog had done things no man in England but himself had ever
dreamed of; in fact, as Othello's perils had won the fair Desdemona's
love, Grog Davis's rascalities had captivated Beecher's admiration; and,
as the recruit might gaze upon the thickly studded crosses on the breast
of some glorious soldier, so did he venerate the proofs of the
thousand-and-one knaveries of one who for thirty-odd years had been a
&ldquo;leg&rdquo; and a swindler.
</p>
<p>
Let us present Captain Davis&mdash;for by that title was he popularly
known&mdash;to our reader. He was a short, red-faced&mdash;very red-faced&mdash;man,
with a profusion of orange-red hair, while he wore beard and whiskers in
that form so common in our Crimean experiences. He was long-armed and
bandy, the legs being singularly short and muscular. He affected dress,
and was remarkable for more ostentation of velvet than consisted with
ordinary taste, and a far greater display of rings, charms, and watch
trinkets than is common even to gentlemen of the &ldquo;Jewish persuasion.&rdquo; The
expression of the man's face was eminently determination, and his
greenish-gray eyes and thin-lipped, compressed mouth plainly declared,
&ldquo;Bet with me or not,&mdash;if you give me the shadow of a shade of
impertinence I 'll fasten a quarrel upon you of which all your rank and
station won't protect you from the consequences. I can hit a sixpence at
twenty paces, and I 'll make you feel that fact in every word you say to
me. In my brevet rank of the turf you can't disown me, and if you try,
mine the fault if you succeed.&rdquo; He had been out three or four times in
very sanguinary affairs, so that the question as to &ldquo;meeting&rdquo; him was a
settled point. He was one of those men to whom the epithet &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo;
 completely applies; he was dangerous alike to the young fellow entering
life, unsuspectful of its wiles and ignorant of its rascalities; dangerous
in the easy facility with which he would make foolish wagers, and lend
even large sums on the very slightest acquaintance. He seemed so impressed
with his theory that everybody ought to have all the enjoyment he liked,
there was such a careless good-nature about him, such an uncalculating
generosity, an air of such general kindliness, that very young men felt at
once at ease in his company; and if there were sundry things in his manner
that indicated coarseness or bad breeding, if his address was vulgar and
his style &ldquo;snobbish,&rdquo; there were sufficient traits of originality about
him to form a set-off for these defects, and &ldquo;Old Grog&rdquo; was pronounced an
&ldquo;out-and-out good fellow,&rdquo; and always ready &ldquo;to help one at a pinch.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Such was he to the very young men just passing the threshold of life; to
the older hands&mdash;fellows versed in all its acts and ways&mdash;he
showed no false colors; such, then, he was, the character which no
disguise conceals,&mdash;&ldquo;the leg;&rdquo; one whose solvency may be counted on
more safely than his honesty, and whose dealings, however based on
roguery, are still guided by that amount of honor which is requisite for
transactions amongst thieves. There was an impression, too,&mdash;we have
no warranty for saying how far it was well founded,&mdash;that Grog was
behind the scenes in transactions where many high and titled characters
figured; that he was confederate in affairs of more than doubtful
integrity; and that, if he liked, he could make revelations such as all
the dark days at Tattersall's never equalled. &ldquo;They 'll never push <i>me</i>
to the wall,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;take my word for it; they 'll not make Grog
Davis turn Queen's evidence,&rdquo; was the boastful exclamation of his
after-dinner hours: and he was right. He could have told of strange doings
with arsenic in the stable, and, stranger still, with hocussed negus in
the back parlor; he had seen the certain favorite for the Oaks carted out
stiff and cold on the morning that was to have witnessed her triumph; and
he had opened the door for the ruined heir as he left his last thousand on
the green baize of the hell table. He was so accustomed to all the
vicissitudes of fortune&mdash;that is, he was so habituated to aid the
goddess in the work of destiny&mdash;that nothing surprised him; and his
red, carbuncled face and jaundiced eye never betrayed the slightest
evidence of anything like emotion or astonishment
</p>
<p>
How could Beecher have felt any other than veneration for one so gifted?
He approached him as might some youthful artist the threshold of Michael
Angelo; he felt, when with him, that he was in the presence of one whose
maxims were silver and whose precepts were gold, and that to the man who
could carry away those experiences the secrets of life were no longer
mysteries.
</p>
<p>
All the delight an old campaigner might have felt had the Great Duke
vouchsafed to tell him of his achievements in the Peninsula&mdash;how he
had planned the masterly defences of Torres Vedras, or conceived the bold
advance upon Spain&mdash;would have been but a weak representation of the
eager enjoyment Beecher experienced when Grog narrated some of his
personal recollections: how he had squared Sir Toby at Manchester; the way
he had won the York Handicap with a dead horse; and the still prouder day
when, by altering the flags at Bolton, he gained twenty-two thousand
pounds on the Great National Steeplechase. Nor was it without a certain
vaingloriousness that Grog would speak of these, as, cigar in mouth and
his hands deep in his breeches pockets, he grunted out, in broken
sentences, the great triumphs of his life.
</p>
<p>
We began this chapter by saying that Lord Lackington was not an
impassioned letter-writer; and here we are discoursing about Mr. Davis and
his habits, as if these topics could possibly have any relation to the
noble Viscount's ways; and yet they are connected, for it was precisely to
read one of his Lordship's letters to his friend that Beecher was now
Grog's guest, seated opposite to him at the fire, in a very humble room of
a very humble cottage on the strand of Irish-town. Grog had sought this
retirement after the last settling at Newmarket, and had been, in popular
phrase, &ldquo;missing&rdquo; since that event.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, it's a long one, at all events,&rdquo; said Mr. Davis, as he glanced
through his double eyeglass at the letter Beecher handed him,&mdash;&ldquo;so
long that I 'll be sworn it had no enclosure. When a man sends the flimsy,
he spares you the flourish!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Right there, Grog. It's all preach and no pay; but read it&rdquo; And he
lighted his cigar, and puffed away.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;'Lake of Como, Oct 15
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What 's the old cove about up at Como so late in the season?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Read it, and you 'll know all,&rdquo; said the other, sententiously.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;'Dear Annesley,&mdash;I have been plotting a letter to you these
half-dozen weeks; but what with engagements, the heat, and that
insurmountable desire to defer whatever can by possibility be put off, all
my good intentions have turned out tolerably like some of your own,&mdash;pleasant
memories, and nothing more. Georgina, too, said&mdash;'
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who's Georgina?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My sister-in-law.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What's she like,&mdash;you never spoke of her?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, nothing particular. She was a Ludworth; they 're a proud set, but
have n't a brass farthing among them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why did he marry her?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who knows? He liked her, I believe,&rdquo; said he, after a pause, as though,
failing a good and valid reason, he gave the next best that offered.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;'Georgina, too, said she 'd write, but the chances are her own
commissions would have been the burden of her letter. She has never
forgotten that bargain of Mechlin lace you once procured her, and always
speculates on some future exercise of your skill.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Annesley burst into a hearty laugh, and said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was amongst the trumpery they gave me at Antwerp for a bill of three
hundred and fifty pounds; I got a Rubens,&mdash;a real Rubens, of course,&mdash;an
ebony cabinet, and twenty yards of coffee-colored 'point de Bruxelles,'
horrid trash; but no matter, I never paid the bill, and Georgina thought
the lace a dead bargain at forty louis.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So that it squared you both?&rdquo; said Grog.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just so, Master Davis. Read on.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;'You must see the utter impossibility of my making any increase to your
present allowance&mdash;'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Hang me if I do, then!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;'&mdash;present allowance. The pressure of so many bad years, the charges
of aiding the people to emigrate, and the cost of this confounded war,
have borne very heavily upon us all, and condemned us to economies that we
never dreamed of. For myself, I have withdrawn my subscription from
several charities, and will neither give a cup at the Broome Regatta, nor
my accustomed ten pounds towards the race ball. I wish I could impress you
with the necessity of similar sacrifices: these are times when every man
must take his share of the national burdens, and reduce his habits of
indulgence in conformity with national exigency.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It 's all very fine to talk of cutting your coat, but when you have n't
got any cloth at all, Master Davis&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I suppose you must take a little of your neighbor's&mdash;if it
don't suit you to go naked. This here noble Lord writes 'like a book;' but
when he says, 'I 'm not a-goin' to stump it,' there 's no more to be said.
You don't want to see the horse take his gallops that you know is to be
scratched on the day of the race,&mdash;that's a mere piece of idle
curiosity, ain't it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Quite true, Grog.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, it's clear he won't He says he won't, and that's enough.&mdash;'We
have come abroad for no other reason than economy, and are only looking
for a place inexpensive enough for our reduced means.' What's his income?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Better than twelve thousand a year.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Has he debts?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I suppose he may; everybody has.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Grog, dryly, and read on.&mdash;&ldquo;'The Continent, however, is
not the cheap place it once was,&mdash;rent, servants, markets, all are
dearer,&mdash;and I 'm quite satisfied you find Ireland much less
expensive than any other part of Europe,'&mdash;which means, 'Stay there,'&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, I don't take it that way,&rdquo; said Beecher, reddening.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I do, and I 'll maintain it,&rdquo; reiterated Grog. &ldquo;He's a knowing one,
that same noble Viscount; he's not the flat you always thought he was. He
can square his own book, he can.&mdash;As to any prospect of places, I
tell you, frankly, there is none. These competitive humbugs they call
examinations do certainly stop a number of importunate people, but the
vigilance of Parliament exercises a most overbearing tyranny on the
ministers; and then the press! Now, we might tide over the House,
Annesley, but the press would surely ruin all. If you were gazetted to-day
Consul to the least-known South American republic,&mdash;commissioner for
the sale of estates in the planet Saturn,&mdash;those fellows would have a
leader on you to-morrow, showing what you did fifteen years ago at Ascot,&mdash;all
your outlawries, all your actions in bankruptcy. They 'd begin saying, 'Is
this the notorious Hon. Annesley Beecher? or are we mistaken in supposing
that the gentleman here referred to is the same lately mentioned in our
columns as the friend and associate of the still more famous Grog Davis?'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He's cool, he is, the noble Lord,&rdquo; said Davis, laying down the letter,
while Beecher laughed till his eyes ran over with tears. &ldquo;Now, I 'd
trouble his Lordship to tell <i>me</i>,&rdquo; continued Grog, &ldquo;which had the
worst of that same acquaintance, and which was more profitable to the
other. If the famous Grog were to split upon the notorious Annes-ley, who
'd come last out of the bag?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You need n't take it so seriously as all that, Grog,&rdquo; said Beecher, in a
placable tone.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, when I'm told that one of the hardest things to be laid to <i>your</i>
charge is the knowing <i>me</i>, it's high time to be serious, I think;
not but I might just throw a shell into the enemy's own camp. The noble
Lord ain't so safe as he fancies. I was head-waiter at Smykes's,&mdash;the
old Cherry-tree, at Richmond&mdash;the night Mat Fortescue was ruined. I
could tell the names of the partners even yet, though it's a matter of I
won't say how many years ago; and when poor Fortescue blew his brains out,
I know the man who drove his phaeton into town and said, 'Fortescue never
had a hand light enough for these chestnuts. I always knew what I could do
with them if they were my own.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Lackington never said that. I 'll take my oath of it he never did!&rdquo; cried
Beecher, passionately.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Take your oath of it!&rdquo; said Davis, with an insulting sneer. &ldquo;Do you mind
the day old Justice Blanchard&mdash;it was at the York assizes&mdash;said,
'Have a care, Mr. Beecher, what you are about to swear; if you persist in
affirming that document, the consequences may be more serious than you
apprehend?' And do you remember you did n't swear?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'll tell you what, Master Grog,&rdquo; said Beecher, over whose face a sudden
paleness now spread, &ldquo;you may speak of <i>me</i> just as you like. You and
I have been companions and pals for many a day; but Lackington is the head
of my family, he has his seat in the Peers, he can hold up his head with
the best in England, and I 'll not sit here to listen to anything against
him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You won't, won't you?&rdquo; said Grog, placing a hand on either knee, and
fixing his fiery gray eyes on the other's face. &ldquo;Well, then, I 'll tell
you that you <i>shall!</i> Sit down, sir,&mdash;sit down, I say, and don't
budge from that chair till I tell you! Do you see that hand? and that arm,&mdash;grasp
it, squeeze it,&mdash;does n't feel very like the sinews of a fellow that
feared hard labor. I was the best ten stone seven man in England the year
I fought Black Joe, and I 'm as tough this minute, so that Norfolk Island
needn't frighten me; but the Hon. Annesley Beecher would n't like it, I
'll promise him. He 'd have precious pains in the shoulder-blades, and
very sore feelings about the small of the back, after the first day's
stone-breaking. Now, don't provoke me, that's all. When the world has gone
so bad with a man as it has with <i>me</i> the last year or two, it's not
safe to provoke him,&mdash;it is not.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I never meant to anger you, old fellow,&rdquo; began Annesley.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Don't do it, then,&mdash;don't, I say,&rdquo; repeated the other, doggedly; and
he resumed the letter, saying: &ldquo;When you 're a-writing the answer to this
here letter, just ask Grog Davis to give you a paragraph. Just say, 'Grog,
old fellow, I 'm writing to my noble brother; mayhap you have a message of
some kind or other for him,' and you 'll see whether he has or not.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You 're a rum one, Master Davis,&rdquo; said Beecher, with a laugh that
revealed very little of a heart at ease.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm one that won't stand a fellow that doesn't run straight with me,&mdash;that's
what I am. And now for the noble Viscount.&rdquo; And he ran his eyes over the
letter without reading aloud. &ldquo;All this here is only saying what sums he
has paid for you, what terrible embarrassment your debts have caused him.
Lord love him! it's no new thing to hear of in this life that paying money
is no pleasure. And then it finishes, as all the stories usually do, by
his swearing he won't do it any more. 'I think,' he says, 'you might come
round by a fortunate hit in marriage; but somehow you blundered in every
case that I pointed out to you&mdash;'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's too bad!&rdquo; cried Beecher, angrily. &ldquo;The only thing he ever 'put me
on' was an iron-master's widow at Barnstable, and I found that the whole
concern was under a contract to furnish rails for a Peruvian line at two
pounds ten a ton under the market price of iron.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was <i>I</i> discovered that!&rdquo; broke in Grog, proudly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So it was, old fellow; and you got me off the match without paying
forfeit.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, this here looks better,&rdquo; continued Grog, reading.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Young and handsome, one of two daughters of an old Irish provision
merchant come abroad for the first time in their life, and consequently
new to everything. The name's O'Reilly, of Mary's Abbey, so that you can
have no difficulty in accurately learning all about him in Dublin. Knowing
that these things are snapped up immediately in the cities, I have induced
O'R. to take a villa on the lake here for the present, so that if your
inquiries turn out satisfactorily, you can come out at once, and we 'll
find the birds where I have landed them.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's business-like,&mdash;that's well and sensibly put,&rdquo; said Davis, in
a voice of no counterfeited admiration.
</p>
<p>
He read on: &ldquo;'O'R. talks of forty thousand to each, but, with the prospect
of connecting himself with people of station, might possibly come down
more handsomely in one case, particularly when brought to see that the
other girl's prospects will be proportionately bettered by this alliance;
at all events, no time is to be lost in the matter, and you can draw on
me, at two months, for fifty pounds, which will carry you out here, and
where, if you should not find me, you will have letters of presentation to
the O'R.'s. It is not a case requiring either time or money,&mdash;though
it may call for more energy and determination than you are in the habit of
exercising. At the proper moment I shall be ready to contribute all in my
power.'
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; said Davis.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I can't even guess; but no matter, the thing sounds well. You can surely
learn all about this O'Reilly?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's easy enough.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I say, I say, old fellow,&rdquo; cried Beecher, as he flung his cigar away and
walked up and down the room briskly, &ldquo;this would put us all on our legs
again. Wouldn't I 'go a heavy pot' on Rolfs stable! I 'd take Coulton's
three-year-old for the Canterbury to-morrow, I would! and give them twelve
to twenty in hundreds on the double event. We'd serve them out, Master
Grog&mdash;we'd give them such a shower-bath, old boy! They say I'm a
flat, but what will they say when A. B.'s number hangs out at the
Stand-house?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There's not much to do on the turf just now,&rdquo; said Grog, dryly. &ldquo;They 've
spoiled the turf,&rdquo; said he, as he lighted his cigar,&mdash;&ldquo;clean spoiled
it. Once upon a time the gents was gents, and the legs legs, but nowadays
every one 'legs' it, as he can; so I 'd like to see who's to make a livin'
out of it!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There's truth in that!&rdquo; chimed in Beecher.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So that,&rdquo; resumed Grog, &ldquo;if you go in for this girl, don't you be making
a book; there's plenty better things to be had now than the ring. There's
companies, and banks, and speculations on every hand. You buy in at, say
thirty, and sell out at eighty, ninety, or a hundred. I 've been a
meditating over a new one I 'll tell you about another time,&mdash;let us
first think about this here marriage,&mdash;it ain't impossible.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Impossible! I should think not, Master Grog. But you will please to
remember that Lackington has no child. I must succeed to the whole thing,&mdash;title
and all.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good news for the Jews, would n't it be?&rdquo; cried Davis. &ldquo;Why, your
outlying paper would n't leave much of a margin to live on. You owe
upwards of a hundred thousand,&mdash;that you do.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I could buy the whole concern to-morrow for five-and twenty thousand
pounds. They can't touch the entail, old fellow!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My word on't, they 'd have it out of you, one way or other; but never
mind, there's time enough to think of these things,&mdash;just stir
yourself about this marriage.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'll start on Monday. I have one or two trifling matters to look after
here, and then I 'm free.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What's this in the turn-down of Lackington's letter marked '<i>Strictly</i>
confidential'?
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;'I meant to have despatched this yesterday, but fortunately
deferred doing so&mdash;fortunately, I say&mdash;as Davenport Dunn has
just arrived  here, with a very important communication, in
which your interest is only inferior to my own. The
explanation would be too long for a letter, and is not
necessary besides, as D. will be in Dublin a day or two
after this reaches you. See him at once; his address is
Merrion Square North, and he will be fully prepared for your
visit. Be on your guard. In truth, D., who is my own
solicitor and man of business in Ireland, is somewhat of a
crafty nature, and may have other interests in his head
paramount to those of, yours,

&ldquo;'Lackington.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
&ldquo;Can you guess what this means, Grog? Has it any reference to the marriage
scheme?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; this is another match altogether,&rdquo; said Grog, sententiously; &ldquo;and
this here Dunn&mdash;I know about him, though I never seen him&mdash;is
the swellest cove going. <i>You</i> ain't fit to deal with <i>him</i>&mdash;you
ain't!&rdquo; added he, contemptuously. &ldquo;If you go and talk to that fellow
alone, I know how 't will be.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come, come, I'm no flat&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Grog's look&mdash;one of intense derision&mdash;stopped him, and after
stammering and blushing deeply, he was silent.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You think, because you have a turn of speed among cripples, that you 're
fast,&rdquo; said Grog, with one of his least amiable grins, &ldquo;but I tell you
that except among things of your own breeding, you'd never save a
distance. Lord love ye! it never makes a fellow sharp to be 'done;' that's
one of the greatest mistakes people ever make. It makes him suspicious,&mdash;it
keeps him on the look-out, as the sailors say; but what's the use of being
on the look-out if you haven't got good eyes? It's the go-ahead makes a
man nowadays, and the cautious chaps have none of that. No, no; don't you
go rashly and trust yourself alone with Dunn. You 'll have to consider
well over this,&mdash;you 'll have to turn it over carefully in your mind.
I 'd not wonder,&rdquo; said he, after a pause, &ldquo;but you 'll have to take <i>me</i>
with you!&rdquo;

<h2>
CHAPTER XIII. A MESSAGE FROM JACK
</h2>
<p>
&ldquo;He's come at last, Bella,&rdquo; said Kellett, as, tired and weary, he entered
the little cottage one night after dark. &ldquo;I waited till I saw him come out
of the station at West-land Row, and drive off to his house.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Did he see you, papa?&mdash;did he speak to you?&rdquo; asked she, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;See <i>me</i>&mdash;speak to <i>me!</i> It's little he was thinking of
me, darling! with Lord Glengariff shaking one of his hands, and Sir Samuel
Downie squeezing the other, and a dozen more crying out, 'Welcome home,
Mr. Bunn! it is happy we are to see you looking so well; we were afraid
you were forgetting poor Ireland and not coming back to us!' And by that
time the carmen took up the chorus, and began cheering and hurrahing,
'Long life and more power to Davenport Dunn!' I give you my word, you 'd
have thought it was Daniel O'Connell, or at least a new Lord-Lieutenant,
if you saw the uproar and excitement there was about him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And he&mdash;how did he take it?&rdquo; asked she.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just as cool as if he had a born right to it all. 'Thank you very much,&mdash;most
kind of you,' he muttered, with a little smile and a wave of his hand, as
much as to say, 'There now, that'll do. Don't you see that I'm travelling
<i>incog.</i>, and don't want any more homage?'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, no, papa,&mdash;not that,&mdash;it was rather like humility&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Humility!&rdquo; said he, bursting into a bitter laugh,&mdash;&ldquo;you know the man
well! Humility! there are not ten noblemen in Ireland this minute has the
pride and impudence of that man. If you saw the way he walked down the
steps to his carriage, giving a little nod here, and a little smile there,&mdash;maybe
offering two fingers to some one of rank in the crowd&mdash;you'd say,
'There's a Prince coming home to his own country,&mdash;see how, in all
their joy, he won't let them be too familiar with him!'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you quite just&mdash;quite fair in all this, dearest papa?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I suppose I'm not,&rdquo; said he, testily. &ldquo;It's more likely the fault
lies in myself,&mdash;a poor, broken-down country gentleman, looking at
everything on the dark side, thinking of the time when his own family were
something in the land, and Mr. Davenport Dunn very lucky if he got leave
to sit down in the servants'-hall. Nothing more likely than that!&rdquo; added
he, bitterly, as he walked up and down the little room in moody
displeasure.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no, papa, you mistake me,&rdquo; said she, looking affectionately at him.
&ldquo;What I meant was this, that to a man so burdened with weighty cares&mdash;one
whose brain carries so many great schemes and enterprises&mdash;a sense of
humility, proud enough in its way, might naturally mingle with all the
pleasures of the moment, whispering as it were to his heart, 'Be not
carried away by this flattery, be not carried away by your own esteem; it
is less you than the work you are destined for that men are honoring.
While they seem to cheer the pilot, it is rather the glorious ocean to
which he is guiding them that they address their salutations.' Might not
some such consciousness as this have moved him at such a time?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed, I don't know, and I don't much care,&rdquo; said Kellett, sulkily. &ldquo;I
suppose people don't feel, nowadays, the way they used when I was young.
There's new inventions in everything.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Human nature is the same in all ages!&rdquo; said she, faintly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faith, and so much the worse for it, Bella. There's more bad than good in
life,&mdash;more cruelty and avarice and falsehood than there's kindness,
benevolence, and honesty. For one good-natured act I 've met with, have
n't I met twenty, thirty, no, but fifty, specimens of roguery and
double-dealing. If you want to praise the world, don't call Paul Kellett
into court, that's all!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So far from agreeing with you,&rdquo; cried she, springing up and drawing her
arm within his, &ldquo;you are exactly the very testimony I'd adduce. From your
own lips have I heard more stories of generosity&mdash;more instances of
self-devotion, trustfulness, and true kindness&mdash;than I have ever
listened to in life.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, amongst the poor, Bella,&mdash;amongst the poor!&rdquo; said Kellett, half
ashamed of his recantation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Be assured, then, that these traits are not peculiar to any class. The
virtues of the poor, like their sufferings, are more in evidence than in
any other condition,&mdash;their lives are laid bare by poverty; but I
feel assured people are better than we think them,&mdash;better than they
know themselves.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'm waiting to hear you tell me that I 'm richer too,&rdquo; said Kellett,
with a half-melancholy laugh,&mdash;&ldquo;that I have an elegant credit in a
bank somewhere, if I only knew where to draw upon it!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is this wealth in the heart of man, if he but knew how to profit by
it: it is to teach us this lesson that great men have arisen from time to
time. The poets, the warriors, the explorers, the great in science, set us
all the same task, to see the world fair as it really is, to recognize the
good around us, to subdue the erroneous thoughts that, like poisonous
weeds, stifle the wholesome vegetation of our hearts, and to feel that the
cause of humanity is our cause, its triumphs our triumphs, its losses our
losses!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It may be all as you say, Bella darling, but it's not the kind of world
ever <i>I</i> saw. I never knew men do anything but cheat each other and
tell lies; and the hardest of it all,&rdquo; added he, with a bitter sigh,
&ldquo;that, maybe, it is your own flesh and blood treats you worst!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This reflection announced the approach of gloomy thoughts. This was about
the extent of any allusion he would ever make to his son, and Bella was
careful not to confirm him in the feeling by discussing or opposing it.
She understood his nature well. She saw that some fortunate incident or
other, even time, might dissipate what had never been more than a mere
prejudice, while, if reasoned with, he was certain to argue himself into
the conviction that of all the rubs he had met in life his son Jack's
conduct was the hardest and the worst.
</p>
<p>
The long and painful silence that now ensued was at length broken by a
loud knocking at the door of the cottage, a sound so unusual as to startle
them both.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's at <i>our</i> door, Bella,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I wonder who it can be?
Beecher couldn't come out this time of the night.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There it is again,&rdquo; said Bella, taking a light. &ldquo;I 'll go and see who's
there.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, let me go,&rdquo; cried Kellett, taking the candle from her hand, and
leaving the room with the firm step of a man about to confront a danger.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Captain Kellett lives here, does n't he?&rdquo; said a tall young fellow, in
the dress of a soldier in the Rifles.
</p>
<p>
Kellett's heart sank heavily within him as he muttered a faint &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm the bearer of a letter for him,&rdquo; said the soldier, &ldquo;from his son.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;From Jack!&rdquo; burst out Kellett, unable to restrain himself. &ldquo;How is he? Is
he well?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He's all right now; he was invalided after that explosion in the
trenches, but he's all right again. We all suffered more or less on that
night;&rdquo; and his eyes turned half inadvertently towards one side, where
Kellett now saw that an empty coat-sleeve was hanging.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was there you left your arm, then, poor fellow,&rdquo; said Kellett, taking
him kindly by the hand. &ldquo;Come in and sit down; I'm Captain Kellett. A
fellow-soldier of Jack's, Bella,&rdquo; said Kellett, as he introduced him to
his daughter; and the young man bowed with all the ease of perfect
good-breeding.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You left my brother well, I hope?&rdquo; said Bella, whose womanly tact saw at
once that she was addressing her equal.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So well that he must be back to his duty ere this. This letter is from
him; but as he had not many minutes to write, he made me promise to come
and tell you myself all about him. Not that I needed his telling me, for I
owe my life to your son, Captain Kellett; he carried me in on his back
under the sweeping fire of a Russian battery; two rifle bullets pierced
his chako as he was doing it; he must have been riddled with shot if the
Russians had not stopped their fire.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stopped their fire!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That they did, and cheered him heartily. How could they help it! he was
the only man on that rude glacis, torn and gullied with shot and shell.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
<a name="linkimage-0007" id="linkimage-0007">
<!-- IMG --></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
<img src="images/10166.jpg" width="100%" alt="166 " />
</div>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, the noble fellow!&rdquo; burst out the girl, as her eyes ran over.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is n't he a noble fellow?&rdquo; said the soldier. &ldquo;We don't want for brave
fellows in that army; but show me one will do what he did. It was a shot
carried off this,&rdquo; said he, touching the empty sleeve of his jacket; &ldquo;and
I said something&mdash;I must have been wandering in my mind&mdash;about a
ring my mother had given me, and it was on the finger of that poor hand.
Well, what does Jack Kellett do, while the surgeon was dressing my wound,
but set off to the place where I was shot down, and, under all that
hailstorm of Minié-balls, brought in the limb. That's the ring,&mdash;he
rescued it at the risk of his life. There's more than courage in that;
there's a goodness and kindness of heart worth more than all the bravery
that ever stormed a battery.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And yet he left me,&mdash;deserted his poor father!&rdquo; cried old Kellett,
sobbing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If he did so, it was to make a name for you that the first man in England
might be proud of.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To go off and list as a common soldier!&rdquo; said Kellett; and then, suddenly
shocked at his own rudeness, and shamed by the deep blush on Sybella's
face, he stammered out, &ldquo;Not but I've known many a man with good blood in
his veins,&mdash;many a born gentleman,&mdash;serving in the ranks.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I hope so,&rdquo; said the other, laughing with a hearty good-nature.
&ldquo;It's not exactly so common a thing with us as with our worthy allies the
French; but every now and then you'll find a firelock in the hands that
once held a double-barrelled Manton, and maybe knocked over the pheasants
in his own father's preserves.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed, I have heard of such things,&rdquo; said Kellett, with a sigh; but he
was evidently lending his assent on small security, because he cared
little for the venture.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How poor Jack loves you!&rdquo; cried Bella, who, deep in her brother's letter,
had paid no attention to what was passing; &ldquo;he calls you Charley,&mdash;nothing
but Charley.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My name is Charles Conway,&rdquo; said the young man, smiling pleasantly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;'Charley,'&rdquo; read she, aloud, &ldquo;'my banker when I have n't a shilling, my
nurse in hospital, my friend always,&mdash;he 'll hand you this, and tell
you all about me. How the dear old dad will love to hear his stories of
campaigning life, so like his own Peninsular tales! He'll see that the
long peace has not tamed the native pluck of the race, but that the
fellows are just as daring, just as steady, just as invincible as ever
they were; and he'll say, too, that to have won the friendship of such a
comrade I must have good stuff in me also.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, if he hadn't gone away and left his old father!&rdquo; broke in Kellett,
lamentingly; &ldquo;sure it was n't the time to leave me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Wasn't it, though?&rdquo; broke in the soldier; &ldquo;I differ with you there. It
was the very moment that every fellow with a dash of spirit about him
should have offered his services. We can't all have commissions,&mdash;we
can't all of us draw handsome allowances from our friends; but we can
surely take our turn in the trenches, and man a battery; and it's not a
bad lesson to teach the common fellow, that for pluck, energy, and even
holding out, the gentleman is at least his equal.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I think it's the first of the name ever served in the ranks,&rdquo; said the
old man, who, with a perverse obstinacy, would never wander from this one
idea.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How joyously he writes!&rdquo; continued Bella, as she bent over the letter:
&ldquo;'I see by the papers, dearest Bella, that we are all disgusted and
dispirited out here,&mdash;that we have nothing but grievances about green
coffee and raw pork, and the rest of it; don't believe a word of it. We do
curse the Commissariat now and then. It smacks like epicurism to abuse the
rations; but ask Charley if these things are ever thought of after we rise
from dinner and take a peep at those grim old earthworks, that somehow
seem growing every day, or if we grumble about fresh vegetables as we are
told off for a covering party. There's plenty of fighting; and if any man
has n't enough in the regular way, he can steal out of a clear night and
have a pop at the Russians from a rifle-pit. I 'm twice as quick a shot as
I was when I left home, and I confess the sport has double the excitement
of my rambles after grouse over Mahers Mountain. It puts us on our mettle,
too, to see our old enemies the French taking the work with us; not but
they have given us the lion's share of it, and left our small army to do
the same duties as their large one. One of the regiments in our brigade,
rather than flinch from their share, returned themselves twelve hundred
strong, while they had close upon three hundred sick,&mdash;ay, and did
the work too. Ask dad if his Peninsulars beat that? Plenty of hardships,
plenty of roughing, and plenty of hard knocks there are, but it's the
jolliest life ever a fellow led, for all that. Every day has its own story
of some dashing bit of bravery, that sets us all wild with excitement,
while we wonder to ourselves what do you all think of us in England. Here
comes an order to summon all to close their letters, and so I shut up,
with my fondest affection to the dear old dad and yourself.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;'Ever yours,
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;'Jack Kellett.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;'As I don't suppose you'll see it in the &ldquo;Gazette,&rdquo; I may as well say
that I 'm to be made a corporal on my return to duty. It's a long way yet
to major-general, but at least I 'm on the road, Bella.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A corporal! a corporal!&rdquo; exclaimed Kellett; &ldquo;may I never, if I know
whether it's not a dream. Paul Kellett's eldest son&mdash;Kellett of
Kellett's Court&mdash;a corporal!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My father's prejudices all attach to the habits of his own day,&rdquo; said
Bella, in a low voice, to the soldier,&mdash;&ldquo;to a time totally unlike the
present in everything.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not in everything, Miss Kellett,&rdquo; said the youth, with a quiet smile.
&ldquo;Jack has just told you that all the old ardor, all the old spirit, is
amongst the troops. They are the sons and grandsons of the gallant fellows
that beat the French out of Spain.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And are <i>you</i> going back?&rdquo; asked Kellett, half moodily, and scarcely
knowing what he said.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They won't have me,&rdquo; said the soldier, blushing as he looked at his empty
sleeve; &ldquo;they want fellows who can handle a Minié rifle.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, to be sure&mdash;I ought to have known&mdash;I was forgetting,&rdquo;
 stammered he out, confusedly; &ldquo;but you have your pension, anyhow.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I've a kind old mother, which is better,&rdquo; said the youth, blushing deeper
again. &ldquo;She only gave me a short leave to run over and see Jack Kellett's
family; for she knows Jack, by name at least, as if he were her own.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
To Bella's questions he replied that his mother had a small cottage near
Bettws, at the foot of Snowdon; it was one of the most picturesque spots
of all Wales, and in one of those sunny nooks where the climate almost
counterfeits the South of Europe.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And now you'll go back, and live tranquilly there,&rdquo; said the girl, half
dreamily, for her thoughts were wandering away Heaven knows where.
</p>
<p>
The youth saw the preoccupation, and arose to take his leave. &ldquo;I shall be
writing to Jack to-morrow, Captain Kellett,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I may say I have
seen you well and hearty, and I may tell the poor fellow&mdash;I 'm sure
you 'll let me tell him&mdash;that you have heartily forgiven him?&rdquo; Old
Kellett shook his head mournfully; and the other went on: &ldquo;It's a hard
thing of a dark night in the trenches, or while you lie on the wet ground
in front of them, thinking of home and far away, to have any one thought
but love and affection in your heart It does n't do to be mourning over
faults and follies, and grieving over things one is sorry for. One likes
to think, too, that they who are at home, happy at their firesides, are
thinking kindly of us. A man's heart is never so stout before the enemy as
when he knows how dear he is to some one far away.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
As the youth spoke these words half falteringly, for he was naturally
bashful and timid, Bella turned her eyes fully upon his, with an interest
she had not felt before, and he reddened as he returned her gaze.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'm sure you forgive me, sir,&rdquo; said he, addressing Kellett. &ldquo;It was a
great liberty I took to speak to you in this fashion; but I was Jack's
comrade,&mdash;he told me every secret he had in the world, and I know how
the poor fellow would march up to a Russian battery to-morrow with an
easier heart than he'd hear one hard word from you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ask Bella there if I ever said a word, ever as much as mentioned his
name,&rdquo; said Kellett, with all the self-satisfaction of egotism.
</p>
<p>
Bella's eyes quickly turned towards the soldier, with an expression so
full of significance that he only gave a very faint sigh, and muttered,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I can do no more; when I next hear from Jack, sir, you shall know
it.&rdquo; And with this he moved towards the door.
</p>
<p>
Bella hastily whispered a few words in her father's ear, to which, as he
seemed to demur, she repeated still more eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How could we, since it's Sunday, and there will be Beecher coming out?&rdquo;
 muttered he.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But this is a gentleman, papa; his soldier jacket is surely no disgrace&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I couldn't, I couldn't,&rdquo; muttered he, doggedly.
</p>
<p>
Again she whispered, and at last he said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe you 'd take your bit of dinner with us tomorrow, Conway,&mdash;quite
alone, you know.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The young fellow drew himself up, and there was, for an instant, a look of
haughty, almost insolent, meaning in his face. There was that, however, in
Bella's which as speedily overcame whatever irritation had crossed his
mind, and he politely said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If you will admit me in this dress,&mdash;I have no other with me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure,&mdash;of course,&rdquo; broke in Kellett. &ldquo;When my son is wearing
the same, what could I say against it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The youth smiled good-naturedly at this not very gracious speech; mayhap
the hand he was then holding in his own compensated for its rudeness, and
his &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; was uttered in all frankness and cordiality.

<h2>
CHAPTER XIV. A DINNER AT PAUL KELLETT'S
</h2>
<p>
To all you gentlemen who live at home at ease there are few things less
troublesome than the arrangement of what is called a dinner-party. Some
difficulty may possibly exist as to the guests. Lady Mary may be
indisposed. It might not be quite right to ask Sir Harry to meet the
Headleys. A stray embarrassment or two will arise to require a little
thought or a little management The material details, however, give no
care. There is a stereotyped mode of feeding one's friends, out of which
it is not necessary, were it even possible, to issue. Your mock-turtle may
have a little more or less the flavor of Madeira; your salmon be somewhat
thicker in the shoulder; your sirloin be a shade more or less underdone;
your side dishes a little more or less uneatable than your neighbor's;
but, after all, from the caviare to the cheese, the whole thing follows an
easy routine, and the dinner of No. 12 is the fac-simile of the dinner at
No. 13; and the same silky voice that whispers &ldquo;Sherry, sir?&rdquo; has its echo
along the whole street The same toned-down uniformity pervades the
intellectual elements of the feast; all is quiet, jogtrot, and habitual; a
gentle atmosphere of murmuring dulness is diffused around, very favorable
to digestion, and rather disposing to sleep.
</p>
<p>
How different are all these things in the case of the poor man, especially
when he happens to be a reduced gentleman, whose memories of the past are
struggling and warring with exigencies of the present and the very
commonest necessities are matters of grave difficulty.
</p>
<p>
Kellett was very anxious to impress his son's friend with a sense of his
social standing and importance, and he told Bella &ldquo;not to mind spending
the whole week's allowance, just to show the soldier what Jack's family
was.&rdquo; A leg of mutton and a little of Kinnahan's port constituted, in his
mind, a very high order of entertainment; and these were at once voted.
Bella hoped that after the first outburst of this ostentatious fit he
would fall back in perfect indifference about the whole matter; but far
from it,&mdash;his waking thought in the morning was the dinner; and when
she remarked to him at breakfast on the threatening aspect of the clouds,
his reply was, &ldquo;No matter, dear, if we have plenty of capers.&rdquo; Even the
unhappy possibility of Beecher's &ldquo;dropping in&rdquo; was subordinate to his wish
to cut a figure on the occasion; and he pottered about from the
dining-room to the kitchen, peeped into saucepans, and scrutinized covered
dishes with a most persistent activity. Nor was Bella herself quite averse
to all this. She saw in the distance&mdash;remotely it might be&mdash;the
glimmering of a renewed interest about poor Jack. &ldquo;The pleasure this
little incident imparts,&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;will spread its influence wider.
He 'll talk of him too; he 'll be led on to let him mingle with our daily
themes. Jack will be one of us once more after this;&rdquo; and so she
encouraged him to make of the occasion a little festival.
</p>
<p>
What skill did she not practise, what devices of taste not display, to
cover over the hard features of their stern poverty! The few little
articles of plate which remained after the wreck of their fortune were
placed on the sideboard, conspicuous amongst which was a cup &ldquo;presented by
his brother officers to Captain Paul Kellett, on his retirement from the
regiment, with which he had served thirty-eight years,&rdquo;&mdash;a
testimonial only exhibited on the very most solemn occasions. His sword
and sash&mdash;the same he wore at Waterloo&mdash;were arrayed over the
fireplace, and his Talavera chako&mdash;grievously damaged by a French
sabre&mdash;hung above them. &ldquo;If he begins about 'that expedition,'&rdquo;&mdash;it
was thus he always designated the war in the Crimea,&mdash;&ldquo;Bella, I 'll
just give him a touch of the real thing, as we had it in the Peninsula!
Faith, it wasn't digging holes in the ground we were then;&rdquo; and he laughed
to himself at the absurdity of the conceit.
</p>
<p>
The few flowers which the garden owned at this late season, humble and
common as they were, figured on the chimney-piece, and not a resource of
ingenuity was neglected to make that little dinner-room look pleasant and
cheery. Fully a dozen times had Kellett gone in and out of the room, never
weary of admiring it, and as constantly muttering to himself some praise
of Bella, to whose taste it was all owing. &ldquo;I 'd put the cup in the middle
of the table, Bella. The wallflowers would do well enough at the
sideboard. Well, maybe you 're right, darling; it is less pretentious, to
be sure. And be careful, dear, that old Betty has a clean apron. May I
never, but she's wearing the same one since Candlemas! And don't leave her
any corks to draw; she's the devil for breaking them into the bottle. I
'll sit here, where I can have the screw at my hand. There 's a great
convenience in a small room, after all. By the good day, here 's Beecher!&rdquo;
 exclaimed he, as that worthy individual approached the door.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What's all this for, Kellett, old boy? Are you expecting the Viceroy, or
celebrating a family festival, eh? What does it mean?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;'T is a mutton chop I was going to give a friend of Jack's,&mdash;a young
fellow that brought me a letter from him yesterday.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh! your son Jack. By the way, what's his regiment,&mdash;Light Dragoons,
is n't it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; the Rifles,&rdquo; said Kellett, with a short cough.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He's pretty high up for his lieutenancy by this, ain't he?&rdquo; said Beecher,
rattling on. &ldquo;He Joined before Alma, didn't he?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; he was at the battle,&rdquo; said Kellett, dryly; for though he had once
or twice told his honorable friend that Jack was in the service, he had
not mentioned that he was in the ranks. Not that Annesley Beecher would
have, in the least, minded the information. The fact could not by
possibility have touched himself; it never could have compelled <i>him</i>
to mount guard, do duty in the trenches, eat Commissariat biscuit, or
submit to any of the hardships soldiery inflicts; and he 'd have heard of
Jack's fate with all that sublime philosophy which teaches us to bear
tranquilly the calamities of others.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why don't you stir yourself to get him a step? There's nothing to be had
without asking! ay, worse than asking,&mdash;begging, worrying,
importuning. Get some fellow in one of the offices to tell you when
there's a vacancy, and then up and at them. If they say, 'We are only
waiting for an opportunity, Captain Kellett,' you reply, 'Now's your time
then, Groves of the Forty-sixth is gone &ldquo;toes up;&rdquo; Simpson, of the Bays,
has cut his lucky this morning.' That's the way to go to work.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are wonderful!&rdquo; exclaimed Kellett, who really did all but worship the
worldly wisdom of his friend.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'd ask Lackington, but he 's no use to any one. Just look at my own
case.&rdquo; And now he launched forth into the theme he really loved and never
found wearisome. His capacity for anything&mdash;everything, his exact
fitness for fifty opposite duties, his readiness to be a sinecurist, and
his actual necessity for a salary, were subjects he could be eloquent on;
devoting occasional passing remarks to Lackington's intense stupidity, who
never exerted himself for him, and actually &ldquo;thought him a flat.&rdquo; &ldquo;I know
you won't believe&mdash;but he does, I assure you&mdash;he thinks me a
flat!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Before Kellett could fully rally from the astounding force of such an
unjustifiable opinion, his guest, Conway, knocked at the door.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I say, Kellett, there comes an apology from your friend.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asked Kellett, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I just saw a soldier come up to the door, and the chances are it 's an
officer's servant with a note of excuse.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The door opened as he spoke, and Conway entered the room. Kellett met him
with an honest cordiality, and then, turning to Beecher, said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My son's friend and comrade,&mdash;Mr. Annesley Beecher;&rdquo; and the two men
bowed to each other, and exchanged glances that scarcely indicated much
pleasure at the acquaintance.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, he 's in the ranks, Kellett,&rdquo; whispered Beecher, as he drew him into
the window.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So is my son,&rdquo; said Kellett, with a gulp that half choked him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The deuce he is; you never told me that. And is this our dinner company?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was just going to explain&mdash;Oh, here's Bella!&rdquo; and Miss Kellett
entered, giving such a cordial greeting to the soldier that made Beecher
actually astounded.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What's his name, Kellett?&rdquo; said Beecher, half languidly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A good name, for the matter of that; he's called Conway.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Conway&mdash;Conway?&rdquo; repeated Beecher, aloud; &ldquo;we have fortieth cousins,
Conways. There was a fellow called Conway in the Twelfth Lancers that went
a tremendous pace; they nicknamed him the 'Smasher,' I don't know why. Do
you?&rdquo; said he, addressing the soldier.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 've heard it was from an awkward habit he had of putting his heel on
snobs.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh! you know him, perhaps?&rdquo; said Beecher, affectedly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, as I was the man myself, I ought, according to the old adage, to say
I knew but little of him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You Conway of the Twelfth! the same that owned Brushwood and Lady Killer,
that won the Riddlesworth?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You're calling up old memories to me,&rdquo; said the youth, smiling, &ldquo;which,
after all, I 'd just as soon forget.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you were an officer in the Lancers!&rdquo; exclaimed Kellett, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; I should have had my troop by this if I hadn't owned those fortunate
three-year-olds Mr. Beecher has just reminded me of. Like many others,
whom success on the turf has misled, I went on madly, quite convinced I
had fortune with me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Beecher, moralizing, &ldquo;there's no doing a good stroke of work
without the legs. Cranley tried it, Hawchcome tried it, Ludborough tried
it, but it won't do. As Grog Davis says, 'you must not ignore existing
interests.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There's another name I have n't heard for many a year. What a scoundrel
that fellow was! I 've good ground for believing that this Davis it was
poisoned Sir Aubrey, the best horse I ever owned. Three men of his stamp
would make racing a sport unfit for gentlemen.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Miss Kellett, will you allow me?&rdquo; said Beecher, offering his arm, and
right well pleased that the announcement of dinner cut short the
conversation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A nice fellow that friend of your brother's,&rdquo; muttered he, as he led her
along; &ldquo;but what a stupid thing to go and serve in the ranks! It's about
the last step I 'd ever have thought of taking.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm certain of it,&rdquo; said Bella, with an assent so ready as to sound like
flattery.
</p>
<p>
As the dinner proceeded, old Kellett's astonishment continued to increase
at the deference paid by Beecher to every remark that fell from Conway.
The man who had twice won &ldquo;the Bexley,&rdquo; and all but won &ldquo;the Elms;&rdquo; he who
owned Sir Aubrey, and actually took the odds against all &ldquo;Holt's stable,&rdquo;
 was no common celebrity. In vain was it Conway tried to lead the
conversation to his friend Jack,&mdash;what they had seen, and where they
had been together,&mdash;Beecher would bring them back to the Turf and the
&ldquo;Racing Calendar.&rdquo; There were so many dark things he wanted to know, so
much of secret history he hoped to be enlightened in; and whenever, as was
often the case, Conway did not and could not give him the desired
information, Beecher slyly intimated by a look towards Kellett that he was
a deep fellow; while he muttered to himself, &ldquo;Grog Davis would have it out
of him, notwithstanding all his cunning.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Bella alone wished to hear about the war. It was not alone that her
interest was excited for her brother, but in the great events of that
great struggle her enthusiastic spirit found ample material for
admiration. Conway related many heroic achievements, not alone of British
soldiers, but of French and even Russians. Gallantry, as he said, was of
no nation in particular,&mdash;there were brave fellows everywhere; and he
told, with all the warmth of honest admiration, how daringly the enemy
dashed into the lines at night and confronted certain death, just for the
sake of causing an interruption to the siege, and delaying, even for a
brief space, the advance of the works. Told, as these stories were, with
all the freshness which actual observation confers, and in a spirit of
unexaggerated simplicity, still old Kellett heard them with the peevish
jealousy of one who felt that they were destined to eclipse in their
interest the old scenes of Spain and Portugal. That any soldiers lived
nowadays like the old Light Division, that there were such fellows as the
fighting Fifth, or Crawfurd's Brigade, no man should persuade him; and
when he triumphantly asked if they had n't as good a general as Sir Arthur
Welles-ley, he fell back, laughing contemptuously at the idea of such
being deemed war at all, or the expedition, as he would term it, being
styled a campaign.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Remember, Captain Kellett, we had a fair share of your old Peninsular
friends amongst us,&mdash;gallant veterans, who had seen everything from
the Douro to Bayonne.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, and did n't they laugh at all this? did n't they tell you fairly it
was not fighting?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'm not so sure they did,&rdquo; said Conway, laughing good-naturedly. &ldquo;Gordon
told an officer in my hearing, that the charge up the heights at the Alma
reminded him strongly of Harding's ascent of the hills at Albuera.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no, don't say that; I can't stand it!&rdquo; cried Kellett, peevishly;
&ldquo;sure if it was only that one thinks they were Frenchmen&mdash;Frenchmen,
with old Soult at their head&mdash;at Albuera&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There's nothing braver than a Russian, sir, depend on 't,&rdquo; said the
youth, with a slight warmth in his tone.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Brave if you like; but, you see, he isn't a soldier by nature, like the
Frenchman; and yet we beat the French, thrashed him from the sea to the
Pyrenees, and over the Pyrenees into France.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What's the odds? You'd not do it again; or, if you did, not get Nap to
abdicate. I 'd like to have two thousand to fifty on the double event,&rdquo;
 said Beecher, chuckling over an imaginary betting-book.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And why not do it again?&rdquo; broke in Bella. &ldquo;Is it after listening to what
we have heard this evening that we have cause for any faint-heartedness
about the spirit of our soldiery? Were Cressy or Agincourt won by braver
fellows than now stand entrenched around Sebastopol?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don't like it; as Grog says, 'never make a heavy book on a waiting
race!'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I conclude, then,&rdquo; said Conway, &ldquo;you are one of those who augur ill of
our success in the present war?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'd not stake an even fifty, on either side,&rdquo; said Beecher, who had
shrewd suspicions that it was what he 'd have called a &ldquo;cross,&rdquo; and that
Todleben and Lord Raglan could make &ldquo;things comfortable&rdquo; at any moment. &ldquo;I
see Miss Bella's of my mind,&rdquo; added he, as he perceived a very peculiar
smile just parting her lips.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I suspect not, Mr. Beecher,&rdquo; said she, slyly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why did you laugh, then?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Shall I tell you? It was just this, then, passing in my mind. I was
wondering within myself whether the habit of reducing all men's motives to
the standard of morality observable in the 'ring' more often lead to
mistakes, or the contrary.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I sincerely trust that it rarely comes right,&rdquo; broke in Conway. &ldquo;I was
close upon four years on the turf, as they call it; and if I had n't been
ruined in time, I 'd have ended by believing that an honest man was as
great a myth as anything we read of amongst the heathen gods.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That all depends upon what you call honest,&rdquo; said Beecher.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure it does; you 're right there,&rdquo; chimed in Kellett; and Beecher,
thus seconded, went on,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now, I call a fellow honest when he won't put his pal into a hole; when
he 'll tell him whenever he has got a good thing, and let him have his
share; when he'll warn him against a dark lot, and not let him 'in' to
oblige any one,&mdash;that's honesty.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, perhaps it is,&rdquo; said Conway, laughing. &ldquo;The Russians said it was
mercy t' other day, when they went about shooting the wounded. There's no
accounting for the way men are pleased to see things.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'd like to have <i>your</i> definition of honesty,&rdquo; said Beecher,
slightly piqued by the last remark.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How can you expect me to give you one? Have I not just told you I was for
more than three years on the turf, had a racing stable, and dealt with
trainers and jocks?&rdquo; He paused for a second or two, and then, in a
stronger voice, went on: &ldquo;I cannot believe that the society of common
soldiers is a very high standard by which to measure either manners or
motives; and yet I pledge my word to it, that my comrades, in comparison
with my old companions of the turf, were unexceptionable gentlemen. I mean
that, in all that regards truthfulness, fair dealing, and honorable
intercourse, it would be insult to compare them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, you see,&rdquo; said Beecher, &ldquo;you got it 'all hot,' as they say. You 're
not an unprejudiced juryman. They gave you a bucketing,&mdash;I heard all
about it. If Corporal Trim had n't been doctored, you 'd have won twelve
thousand at Lancaster.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Conway smiled good-humoredly at the explanation thus suggested, but said
nothing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bother it for racing,&rdquo; said Kellett &ldquo;I never knew any real taste for
horses or riding where there was races. Instead of caring for a fine,
showy beast, a little thick in the shoulder, square in the joints, and
strong in the haunch, they run upon things like greyhounds, all drawn up
behind and low before; it's a downright misery to mount one of them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But it's a real pleasure to see him come in first, when your book tells
you seven to one in your favor. Talk of sensations,&rdquo; said he,
enthusiastically; &ldquo;where is there the equal of that you feel when the
orange and blue you have backed with a heavy pot comes pelting round the
corner, followed by two,&mdash;then three,&mdash;all punishing, your own
fellow holding on beautifully, with one eye a little thrown backward to
see what's coming, and that quiet, calm look about the mouth that says, 'I
have it.' Every note of the wild cheer that greets the winner is applause
to your own heart; that deafening yell is your own song of triumph.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Listen to him!&mdash;that 's his hobby,&rdquo; cried Kellett, whose eyes
glistened with excitement at the description, and who really felt an
honest admiration for the describer. &ldquo;Ah, Beecher, my boy!&mdash;you 're
at home there.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If they 'd only give me a chance, Paul,&mdash;one chance!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Whether it was that the expression was new and strange to him, or that the
energy of the speaker astonished him, but Conway certainly turned his eyes
towards him in some surprise; a sentiment which Beecher at once
interpreting as interest, went on,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>You</i>,&rdquo; said he,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>you</i> had many a chance; <i>I</i> never
had one. You might have let them all in, you might have landed them all&mdash;so
they tell me, at least&mdash;if you'd have withdrawn Eyetooth. He was own
brother to Aurelius, and sure to win. Well, if you 'd have withdrawn him
for the Bexley, you'd have netted fifty thousand. Grog&mdash;I mean a
fellow 'well up' among the legs&mdash;told me so.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your informant never added what every gentleman in England would have
said of me next day,&rdquo; said Conway. &ldquo;It would have been neither more nor
less than a swindle. The horse was in perfect health and top condition,&mdash;why
should I not have run him?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;For no other reason that I know, except that you 'd have been richer by
fifty thousand for not doing it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Conway, quietly, &ldquo;it's not a very pleasant thing to be
crippled in this fashion; but I 'd rather lose the other arm than do what
you speak of. And if I did n't know that many gentlemen get a loose way of
talking of fifty things they 'd never seriously think of doing, I 'd
rather feel disposed to be offended at what you have just said.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Offended! of course not,&mdash;I never dreamed of anything offensive. I
only meant to say that they call <i>me</i> a flat; but hang me if I'd have
let them off as cheaply as you did.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then they're at perfect liberty to call me a flat also,&rdquo; said Conway,
laughing. &ldquo;Indeed, I suspect I have given them ample reason to think me
one.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The look of compassionate pity Beecher bestowed on him as he uttered these
words was as honest as anything in his nature could be.
</p>
<p>
It was in vain Bella tried to get back the conversation to the events of
the campaign, to the scenes wherein poor Jack was an actor. Beecher's
perverse activity held them chained to incidents which, to him, embraced
all that was worth living for. &ldquo;You must have had some capital things in
your time, though. You had some race-horses, and were well in with Tom
Nolan's set,&rdquo; said he to Conway.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Shall I tell you the best match I ever had,&mdash;at least, the one gave
me most pleasure?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do, by all means,&rdquo; said Beecher, eagerly, &ldquo;though I guess it already. It
was against Vickersley, even for ten thousand, at York.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the other, smiling.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, then, it was the Cotswold,&mdash;four miles in two heats. You won
it with a sister to Ladybird.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nor that, either; though by these reminiscences you show me how
accurately you have followed my humble fortunes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There 's not a man has done anything on the turf for fifty years I can't
give you his history; not a horse I won't tell you all his performances,
just as if you were reading it out of the 'Racing Calendar.' As 'Bell's
Life' said t' other day, 'If Annesley Beecher can't answer that question,'&mdash;and
it was about Running Rein,&mdash;'no man in England can.' I'm 'The Fellow
round the corner' that you always see alluded to in 'Bell.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Conway, with assumed deference.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That I am,&mdash;Kellett knows it. Ask old Paul there,&mdash;ask Grog,&mdash;ask
any one you like, whether A. B. is up to a thing or two. But we 're
forgetting this match,&mdash;the best thing you said you ever had.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'm not so sure you 'll be of my mind when you hear it,&rdquo; said Conway,
smiling. &ldquo;It was a race we had t' other day in the Crimea,&mdash;a
steeplechase, over rather a stiff course, with Spanish ponies; and I rode
against Lord Broodale, Sir Harry Curtis, and Captain Marsden, and won five
pounds and a dozen of champagne. My comrades betted something like fifty
shillings on the match, and there would have been a general bankruptcy in
the company if I had lost. Poor Jack mortgaged his watch and a pilot coat
that he was excessively proud of,&mdash;it was the only bit of mufti in
the battalion, I think; but he came off all right, and treated us all to a
supper with his winnings, which, if I don't mistake, did n't pay more than
half the bill.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good luck to him, and here's his health,&rdquo; cried Kellett, whose heart,
though proof against all ordinary appeals to affection, could not
withstand this assault of utter recklessness and improvidence. &ldquo;He's my
own flesh and blood, there's no denying it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
If Conway was astounded at this singular burst of paternal affection, he
did not the less try to profit by it, and at once began to recount the
achievements of his comrade, Jack Kellett. The old man listened half
doggedly at first, but gradually, as the affection of others for his son
was spoken of, he relaxed, and heard, with an emotion he could not easily
repress, how Jack was beloved by the whole regiment,&mdash;that to be his
companion in outpost duty, to be stationed with him in a battery, was a
matter of envy. &ldquo;I won't say,&rdquo; said Conway, &ldquo;that every corps and every
company has not fellows brave as he; but show me one who 'll carry a
lighter spirit into danger, and as soft a heart amid scenes of cruelty and
bloodshed. So that if you asked who in our battalion is the pluckiest, who
the most tenderhearted, who the most generous, and who the least given to
envy, you'd have the one answer, 'Jack Kellett,' without a doubt.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what will it all do for him?&rdquo; broke in the old man, resorting once
more to his discontent.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What will it do for him? What has it done for him? Is it nothing that in
a struggle history will make famous a man's name is a household word; that
in a war where deeds of daring are so rife, his outnumbers those of any
other? It's but a few weeks back a Sardinian staff-officer, coming to our
head-quarters on business, asked if the celebrated 'Bersagliere' was
there,&mdash;so they call riflemen,&mdash;and desired to see him; and,
better than that, though he didn't know Jack's name, none doubted who was
meant, but Jack Kellett was sent for on the instant. Now, that I call
fame.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Will it get him his commission?&rdquo; said Beecher, knowingly, as though by
one shrewd stroke of intelligence he had embraced the entire question.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A commission can be had for four hundred and fifty pounds, and some man
in Parliament to ask for it. But what Jack has done cannot be bought by
mere money. Do you go out there, Mr. Beecher, just go and see for yourself&mdash;it's
well worth the while&mdash;what stuff fellows are made of that face danger
every day and night, without one thought above duty, never expecting,
never dreaming that anything they do is to have its personal benefit, and
would far rather have their health drunk by their comrades than be quoted
in the 'Times.' You'll find your old regiment there,&mdash;you were in the
Fusilier Guards, weren't you?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I tried soldiering, but I did n't like it,&rdquo; said Beecher; &ldquo;and it
was better in my day than <i>now</i>, they tell me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A movement of impatience on Conway's part was suddenly interrupted by
Kellett, saying, &ldquo;He means that the service is n't what it was; and indeed
he's right there. I remember the time there wasn't a man in the
Eighty-fifth could n't carry away three bottles of Bennett's strong port,
and play as good a rubber, afterwards, as Hoyle himself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's the snobbery I was thinking of,&rdquo; said Beecher; &ldquo;fellows go into the
army now who ought to be counter-jumping.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don't know what they ought to be doing,&rdquo; broke in Conway, angrily, &ldquo;but
I could tell you something of what they are doing; and where you are to
find men to do it better, I 'm not so clear. I said a few moments back,
you ought to go out to the Crimea; but I beg to correct myself,&mdash;it
is exactly what you ought not to do.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Never fear, old fellow; I never dreamed of it. Give you any odds you
like, you 'll never see my arrival quoted at Balaklava.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A thousand pardons, Miss Kellett,&rdquo; whispered Conway, as he arose, &ldquo;but
you see how little habit I have of good company; I'm quite ashamed of my
warmth. May I venture to come and pay you a morning visit before I go
back?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, by all means; but why not an evening one? You are more certain to
find us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then an evening one, if you'll allow me;&rdquo; and shaking Kellett's hand
warmly, and with a cold bow to Beecher, he withdrew.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Wasn't he a flat!&rdquo; cried Beecher, as the door closed after him. &ldquo;The
Smasher&mdash;that was the name he went by&mdash;went through an estate of
six thousand a year, clean and clear, in less than four years, and there
he is now, a private soldier with one arm!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faith, I like him; he's a fine fellow,&rdquo; said Kellett, heartily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ask Grog Davis if he'd call him a fine fellow,&rdquo; broke in Beecher,
sneeringly; &ldquo;there's not such a spoon from this to Newmarket. Oh, Paul, my
hearty, if I had but one, just one of the dozen chances he has thrown
away! But, as Grog says, 'a crowbar won't make a cracksman;' nor will a
good stable of horses, and safe jocks 'bring a fellow round,' if he hasn't
it here.&rdquo; And he touched his forehead with his forefinger most
significantly.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Charles Conway sauntered slowly back to town, on the whole
somewhat a sadder man than he had left it in the morning. His friend Jack
had spoken much to him of his father and sister, and why or to what extent
he knew not, but somehow they did not respond to his own self-drawn
picture of them. Was it that he expected old Kellett would have been a
racier version of his son,&mdash;the same dashing, energetic spirit,&mdash;seeing
all for the best in life, and accepting even its reverses in a
half-jocular humor? Had he hoped to find in him Jack's careless, easy
temper,&mdash;a nature so brimful of content as to make all around sharers
in its own blessings; or had he fancied a &ldquo;fine old Irish gentleman&rdquo; of
that thoroughbred school he had so often heard of?
</p>
<p>
Nor was he less disappointed with Bella; he thought she had been
handsomer, or, at least, quite a different kind of beauty. Jack was
blue-eyed and Saxon-looking, and he fancied that she must be a &ldquo;blonde,&rdquo;
 with the same frank, cheery expression of her brother; and he found her
dark-haired and dark-skinned, almost Spanish in her look,&mdash;the cast
of her features grave almost to sadness. She spoke, too, but little, and
never once reminded him, by a tone, a gesture, or a word, of his old
comrade.
</p>
<p>
Ah! how these self-created portraits do puzzle and disconcert us through
life! How they will obtrude themselves into the foreground, making the
real and the actual but mere shadows in the distance! What seeming
contradiction, too, do they create as often as we come into contact with
the true, and find it all so widely the reverse of what we dreamed of! How
often has the weary emigrant sighed over his own created promised land in
the midst of the silent forest or the desolate prairie! How has the poor
health-seeker sunk heavy-hearted amid scenes which, had he not
misconstrued them to himself, he had deemed a paradise!
</p>
<p>
These &ldquo;phrenographs&rdquo; are very dangerous paintings, and the more so that we
sketch them in unconsciously.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Jack is the best of them; that's clear,&rdquo; said Conway, as he walked along;
and yet, with all his affection for him, the thought did not bring the
pleasure it ought to have done.

<h2>
CHAPTER XV. A HOME SCENE
</h2>
<p>
When Paul Kellett described Mr. Davenport Dunn's almost triumphal entry
into Dublin, he doubtless fancied in his mind the splendors that awaited
him at home; the troops of servants in smart liveries, the homage of his
household, and the costly entertainment which most certainly should
celebrate his arrival. Public rumor had given to the hospitalities of that
house a wide extended fame. The fashionable fishmonger of the capital, his
Excellency's &ldquo;purveyor&rdquo; of game, the celebrated Italian warehouse, all
proclaimed him their best customer. &ldquo;Can't let you have that turbot, sir,
till I hear from Mr. Dunn.&rdquo; &ldquo;Only two pheasants to be had, sir, and
ordered for Mr. Dunn.&rdquo; &ldquo;The white truffles only taken by one gentleman in
town. None but Mr. Dunn would pay the price.&rdquo; The culinary traditions of
his establishment threw the Castle into the background, and Kellett
revelled in the notion of the great festivity that now welcomed his
return. &ldquo;Lords and earls&mdash;the biggest salmon in the market&mdash;the
first men of the land&mdash;and lobster sauce&mdash;ancient names and good
families&mdash;with grouse, and 'Sneyd's Twenty-one'&mdash;that 's what
you may call life! It is wonderful, wonderful!&rdquo; Now, when Paul enunciated
the word &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; in this sense, he meant it to imply that it was
shameful, distressing, and very melancholy for the prospects of humanity
generally. And then he amused himself by speculating whether Dunn liked it
all,&mdash;whether the unaccustomed elegance of these great dinners did
not distress and pain him rather than give pleasure, and whether the very
consciousness of his own low origin wasn't a poison that mingled in every
cup he tasted.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's no use talking,&rdquo; muttered he to himself; &ldquo;a man must be bred to it,
like everything else. The very servants behind his chair frighten him;
he's, maybe, eating with his knife, or he's putting salt where he ought to
put sugar, or he does n't take the right kind of wine with his meat.
Beecher says he 'd know any fellow just by that, and then it's 'all up'
with him. Wonderful, wonderful!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
How would it have affected these speculations had Kellett known that,
while he was indulging them, Dunn had quietly issued by a back door from
his house, and, having engaged a car, set out towards Clontarf? A drearier
drive of a dreary evening none need wish for. Occasional showers were
borne on the gusty wind, swooping past as though hurrying to some
elemental congress far away, while along the shore the waves beat with
that irregular plash that betokens wild weather at sea. The fitful
moonlight rather heightened than diminished the dismal aspect of the
scenery. For miles the bleak strand stretched away, no headland nor even a
hillock marking the coast; the spectral gable of a ruined church being the
only object visible against the leaden sky. Little garlands of paper, the
poor tributes of the very poor, decorated the graves and the head-stones,
and, as they rustled in the night wind, sounded like ghostly whisperings.
The driver piously crossed himself as they passed the &ldquo;un-cannie&rdquo; spot,
but Dunn took no heed of it. To wrap his cloak tighter about him, to
shelter more closely beneath his umbrella, were all that the dreary scene
exacted from him; and except when a vivid flash of lightning made the
horse swerve from the road and dash down into the rough shingle of the
strand, he never adverted to the way or the weather.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What's this,&mdash;where are we going?&rdquo; cried he, impatiently.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;'T is the flash that frightened the beast, yer honner,&rdquo; said the man;
&ldquo;and if it was plazin' to you, I 'd rather tarn back again.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Turn back&mdash;where to?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To town, yer honner.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nothing of the kind; drive on, and quickly too. We have five miles yet
before us, and it will be midnight ere we get over them at this rate.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Sulkily and unwillingly did he obey; and, turning from the shore, they
entered upon a low, sandy road that traversed a wide and dreary tract,
barely elevated a few feet above the sea. By degrees the little patches of
grass and fern disappeared, and nothing stretched on either side but low
sand hummocks, scantily covered with rushes. Sea-shells crackled beneath
the wheels as they went, and after a while the deep booming of the sea
thundering heavily along a sandy shore, apprised them that they had
crossed the narrow neck of land which divided two bays.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you quite certain you I 've taken the right road, my man?&rdquo; cried
Dunn, as he observed something like hesitation in the other's manner.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It ought to be somewhere hereabout we turn off,&rdquo; said the man, getting
down to examine more accurately from beneath. &ldquo;There was a little cross
put up to show the way, but I don't see it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But you have been here before. Ton told me you knew the place.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was here onst, and, by the same token, I swore I 'd never come again. I
lamed the best mare I ever put a collar on, dragging through this deep
sand. Wirra, wirra! why the blazes would n't he live where other
Christians do! There it is now; I see a light. Ah! bother them, it's out
again.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Pushing forward as well as he might in the direction he had seen the
light, he floundered heavily on, the wheels sinking nearly to the axles,
and the horse stumbling at every step.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your horse is worth nothing, my good fellow; he has n't strength to keep
his legs,&rdquo; said Dunn, angrily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good or bad, I 'll give you lave to broil me on a gridiron if ever ye
catch me coming the same road again. Ould Duun won't have much company if
he waits for me to bring them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'll take good care not to tempt you!&rdquo; said Dunn, angrily.
</p>
<p>
And now they plodded on in moody silence till they issued forth upon a
little flat space, bounded on three sides by the sea, in the midst of
which a small two-storied house stood, defended from the sea by a rough
stone breakwater that rose above the lower windows.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There it is now, bad luck to it!&rdquo; said the carman, savagely, for his
horse was so completely exhausted that he was obliged to walk at his head
and lift him at every step.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You may remain here till I want you,&rdquo; said Dunn, getting down and
plodding his way through the heavy sand. Flakes of frothy seadrift swept
past him as he went, and the wild wind carried the spray far inland in
heavy showers, beating against the walls and windows of the lonely house,
and making the slates rattle. A low wall of large stones across the door
showed that all entrance by that means was denied; and Dunn turned towards
the back of the house, where, sheltered by the low wall, a small door was
detectable. He knocked several times at this before any answer was
returned; when, at last, a harsh voice from within called out,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Don't ye hear who it is? confound ye! Open the door at once!&rdquo; and Dunn
was admitted into a large kitchen, where in a great straw chair beside the
fire was seated the remains of a once powerful man, and who, although
nearly ninety years of age, still preserved a keen eye, a searching look,
and a quick impatience of manner rarely observable at his age.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, father, how are you?&rdquo; said Dunn, taking him affectionately by both
hands, and looking kindly in his face.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Hearty,&mdash;stout and hearty,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;When did you arrive?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A couple of hours ago. I did not wait for anything but a biscuit and a
glass of wine, when I set out here to see you. And you are well?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just as you see: an odd pain or so across the back, and a swimming of the
head,&mdash;a kind of giddiness now and then, that's all. Put the light
over there till I have a look at you. You 're thinner, Davy,&mdash;a deal
thinner, than when you went away.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have nothing the matter with me; a little tired or so, that's all,&rdquo;
 said Dunn, hastily. &ldquo;And how are things doing here, father, since I left?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There's little to speak of,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;There never is much doing
at this season of the year. You heard, of course, that Gogarty has lost
his suit; they 're moving for a new trial, but they won't get it. Lanty
Moore can't pay up the rest of the purchase for Slanestown, and I told
Hankes to buy it in. Kelly's murderer was taken on Friday last, near
Kilbride, and offers to tell, God knows what, if they won't hang him; and
Sir Gilbert North is to be the new Secretary, if, as the 'Evening Mail'
says, Mr. Davenport Dunn concurs in the appointment&rdquo;&mdash;and here the
old man laughed till his eyes ran over. &ldquo;That's all the news, Davy, of the
last week; and now tell me yours. The papers say you were dining with
kings and queens, and driving about in royal coaches all over the
Continent,&mdash;was it true, Davy?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You got my letters, of course, father?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; and I could n't make out the names, they were all new and strange to
me. I want to have from yourself what like the people are,&mdash;are they
as hard-working, are they as 'cute as our own? There's just two things now
in the world,&mdash;coal and industry,&mdash;sorra more than that And so
you dined with the King of France?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;With the Emperor, father. I dined twice; he took me over to Fontainebleau
and made me stay the day.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You could tell him many a thing he'd never hear from another, Davy; you
could explain to him what's doing here, and how he might imitate it over
there,&mdash;rooting out the old vermin and getting new stock in the land,&mdash;eh,
Davy?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He needs no counsels, at least from such as me,&rdquo; said Dunn.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faith, he might have worse, far worse. An Encumbered Estate Court would
do all his work for him well, and the dirty word 'Confiscation' need never
be uttered!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He knows the road he wants to go,&rdquo; said Dunn, curtly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So he may; but that does n't prove it 's the best way.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Whichever path he takes he'll tread it firmly, father, and that's more
than half the battle. If you only saw what a city he has made Paris&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's just what I don't like. What's the good of beautifying and gilding
or ornamenting what you 're going to riddle with grape and smash with
round shot? It's like dressing a sweep in a field-marshal's uniform, And
we all know where it will be to-morrow or next day.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That we don't, sir. You 're not aware that these spacious thoroughfares,
these wide squares, these extended terraces, are so contrived that columns
may march and manoeuvre in them, squadrons charge, and great artillery act
through them. The proudest temples of that splendid city serve as
bastions; the great Louvre itself is less a palace than a fortress.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, ay, ay,&rdquo; cackled the old man, to whom these revelations opened a new
vista of thought. &ldquo;But what's the use of it, after all, Davy? He must
trust somebody; and when it comes to that with anybody in life, where 's
his security, tell me that? But let us talk about home. Is it true the
Ministry is going out?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They're safer than ever; take my word for it, father, that these fellows
know the trick of it better than all that went before them. They 'll just
do whatever the nation and the 'Times' dictate to them; a little slower,
mayhap, than they are ordered, but they 'll do it They have no
embarrassments of a policy of any kind; and the only pretence of a
principle they possess is to sit on the Treasury benches.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And they 're right, Davy,&mdash;they 're right,&rdquo; said the old man,
energetically.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don't doubt but they are, sir; the duty of the pilot is to take charge
of the ship, but not to decide the port she sails for.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wish you were one of them, Davy; they'd suit you, and you 'd suit <i>them</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So we should, sir; and who knows what may turn up? I'm not impatient&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's right, Davy; that's the lesson I always taught you; wait,&mdash;wait!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;When did you see Driscoll, father?&rdquo; asked Dunn, after a pause.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He was here last week; he's up to his ears about that claim to the
Beecher estate, Lord&mdash;Lord&mdash;What's his&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Lackington.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Lord Lackington. He says if you were once come home, you 'd get him
leave to search the papers in the Record Tower at the Castle, and that it
would be the making of himself if anything came out of it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He's always mare's-nesting, sir,&rdquo; said Dunn, carelessly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faith, he has contrived to feather his own nest, anyhow,&rdquo; said the old
man, laughing. &ldquo;He lent Lord Glengariff five thousand pounds t' other day
at six per cent, and on as good security as the Bank.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Does he pretend to have discovered anything new with respect to that
claim?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He says there's just enough to frighten them, and that <i>your</i> help&mdash;the
two of ye together&mdash;could work it well.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He has not, then, found out the claimant?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He has his name, and the regiment he's in, but that's all. He was talking
of writing to him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If he's wise, he'll let it alone. What chance would a poor soldier in the
ranks have against a great lord, if he had all the right in the world on
his side?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So I told him; but he said we could make a fine thing out of it, for all
that; and, somehow, Davy, he's mighty seldom mistaken.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If he be, sir, it is because he has hitherto only meddled with what lay
within his power. He can scheme and plot and track out a clew in the
little world he has lived in; but let him be careful how he venture upon
that wider ocean of life where his craft would be only a cock-boat.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He hasn't <i>your</i> stuff in him, Davy,&rdquo; cried the old man, in ecstasy;
and a very slight flush rose to the other's cheek at the words, but
whether of pride, or shame, or pleasure, it were hard to say. &ldquo;I 've
nothing to offer you, Davy, except a cut of cold pork; could you eat it?&rdquo;
 said the old man.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm not hungry, father; I'm tired somewhat, but not hungry.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm tired, too,&rdquo; said the old man, sighing; &ldquo;but, to be sure, it's time
for me,&mdash;I 'll be eighty-nine if I live till the fourth of next
month. That's a long life, Davy.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And it has been an active one, sir.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 've seen great changes in my time, Davy,&rdquo; continued he, following out
his own thoughts. &ldquo;I was in the Volunteers when we bullied the English,
and they 've paid us off for it since, that they have! I was one of the
jury when Jackson died in the dock, and if he was alive now, maybe it's a
lord of the Treasury he 'd be. Everything is changed, and everybody too.
Do you remember Kellett, of Kellett's Court, that used to drive on the
Circular Road with six horses?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Dunn nodded an assent.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;His liveries were light-blue and silver, and Lord Castletown's was the
same; and Kellett said to him one day, 'My Lord,' says he, 'we're always
mistaken for each other; could n't we hit on a way to prevent it?' 'I'm
willing,' says my Lord, 'if I only knew how.' 'Then I 'll tell you,' says
Kellett; 'make your people follow your own example and turn their coats,&mdash;that'll
do it,' says he.&rdquo; And the old man laughed till his eyes swam. &ldquo;What's
become of them Kelletts?&rdquo; added he, sharply.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ruined,&mdash;sold out&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure, I remember all about it; and the young fellow,&mdash;Paul was
his name,&mdash;where's he?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He's not so very young now,&rdquo; said Dunn, smiling; &ldquo;he has a clerkship in
the Customs,&mdash;a poor place it is.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm glad of it,&rdquo; said he, fiercely; &ldquo;there was an old score between us,&mdash;that's
his father and me,&mdash;and I knew I would n't die till it was settled.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;These are not kindly feelings, father,&rdquo; said Dunn, mildly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; but they 're natural ones, and that's as good,&rdquo; said the old man,
with an energy that seemed to defy his age. &ldquo;Where would I be now, where
would you, if it was only kindness we thought of? There wasn't a man in
all Ireland I wanted to be quite with so much as old Kellett of Kellett's
Court; and you'd not wonder if you knew why; but I won't tell.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Davenport Dunn's cheek grew crimson and then deadly pale, but he never
uttered a word.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what's more,&rdquo; continued the old man, energetically, &ldquo;I'd pay the debt
off to his children and his children's children with interest, if I
could.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Still was the other silent; and the old man looked angry that he had not
succeeded in stimulating the curiosity he had declared he would not
gratify.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Fate has done the work already, sir,&rdquo; said Dunn, gravely. &ldquo;Look where <i>we</i>
are, and where <i>they!</i>&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That 's true,&mdash;that's true; we have a receipt in full for it all;
but I 'd like to show it to him. I 'd like to say to him, 'Mr. Kellett,
once upon a time, when my son there was a child&mdash;'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Father, father, these memories can neither make us wiser nor happier,&rdquo;
 broke in Dunn, in a voice of deep emotion. &ldquo;Had I taken upon me to carry
through life the burden of resentments, my back had been broken long ago;
and from your own prudent counsels I learned that this could never lead to
success. The men whom destiny has crushed are like bankrupt debtors, and
to pursue them is but to squander your own resources.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The old man sat moodily, muttering indistinctly to himself, and evidently
little moved by the words he had listened to.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you going away already?&rdquo; cried he, suddenly, as Dunn rose from his
chair.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir; I have a busy day before me to-morrow, and need some sleep to
prepare for it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What will you be doing to-morrow, Davy?&rdquo; asked the old man, while a
bright gleam of pride lighted up his eyes and illuminated his whole face.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have deputations to receive,&mdash;half a dozen, at least. The Drainage
Commission, too, will want me, and I must contrive to have half an hour
for the Inland Navigation people; then the Attorney-General will call
about these prosecutions, and I have not made up my mind about them; and
the Castle folk will need some clew to my intentions about the new
Secretary; there are some twenty provincial editors, besides, waiting for
directions, not to speak of private and personal requests, some of which I
must not refuse to hear. As to letters, three days won't get through them;
so that you see, father, I do need a little rest beforehand.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;God bless you, my boy,&mdash;God bless you, Davy,&rdquo; cried the old man,
tenderly, grasping his hand in both his own. &ldquo;Keep the head clear, and
trust nobody; that's the secret,&mdash;trust nobody; the only mistakes I
ever made in life was when I forgot that rule.&rdquo; And affectionately kissing
him, the father dismissed his son, muttering blessings on him as he went.

<h2>
CHAPTER XVI. DAVIS VERSUS DUNN.
</h2>
<p>
Davenport Dunn had not exaggerated when he spoke of a busy day for the
morrow. As early as eight o'clock was he at breakfast, and before nine the
long back parlor, with its deep bay-window, was crowded like the
waiting-room of a fashionable physician. Indeed, in the faces of anxiety,
eagerness, and impatience of those assembled there, there was a
resemblance. With a tact which natural shrewdness and long habit could
alone confer, Mr. Clowes, the butler, knew exactly where each arrival
should be introduced; and while railway directors, bank governors, and
great contractors indiscriminately crowded the large dining-room, peers
and right honorables filled the front drawing-room, the back one being
reserved for law officers of the Crown, and such secret emissaries as came
on special mission from the Castle. From the hall, crammed with
frieze-coated countryfolk, to the little conservatory on the stairs, where
a few ladies were grouped, every space was occupied. Either from previous
acquaintance, or guided by the name of the visitor, Mr. Clowes had little
difficulty in assigning him his fitting place, dropping, as he accompanied
him, some few words, as the rank and station of the individual might
warrant his addressing to him. &ldquo;I 'll let Mr. Dunn know your Lordship is
here this instant; he is now just engaged with the Chief Baron.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He
'll see you, Sir Samuel, next.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Wilcox, you have no chance for
two hours; the Foyle deputation is just gone in.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;You need scarcely
wait to-day, Mr. Tobin; there are eighteen before you.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Colonel
Craddock, you are to come on Saturday, and bring the plans with you.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Too
late, Mr. Dean; his Grace the Archbishop waited till a quarter to eleven,
the appointment is now for to-morrow at one.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No use in staying, my
honest fellow, your own landlord could n't see Mr. Dunn to-day.&rdquo; In the
midst of such brief phrases as these, while he scattered hopes and
disappointments about him, he suddenly paused to read a card, stealing a
quick glance at the individual who presented it &ldquo;'Mr. Annesley Beecher.'
By appointment, sir?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I suppose I might say yes,&rdquo; muttered the visitor, while he turned
to a short and very overdressed person at his side for counsel in the
difficulty.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure&mdash;by appointment,&rdquo; said the other, confidently, while he
bestowed on the butler a look of unmistakable defiance.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And this&mdash;gentleman&mdash;is with you, sir?&rdquo; asked the butler,
pausing ere he pronounced the designation. &ldquo;Might I request to have his
name?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Captain Davis,&rdquo; said the short man, interposing. &ldquo;Write it under your
own, Beecher.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
While Mr. Annesley Beecher was thus occupied,&mdash;and, sooth to say, it
was an office he did not discharge with much despatch,&mdash;Clowes had
ample time to scan the appearance and style of the strangers.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If you 'll step this way, sir,&rdquo; said Clowes, addressing Beecher only,
&ldquo;I'll send in your card at once.&rdquo; And he ushered them as he spoke into the
thronged dinner-room, whose crowded company sat silent and moody, each man
regarding his neighbor with a kind of reproachful expression, as though
the especial cause of the long delay he was undergoing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You ought to 'tip' that flunkey, Beecher,&rdquo; said Davis, as soon as they
were alone in a window.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Haven't the tin, Master Grog!&rdquo; said the other, laughing; while he added,
in a lower voice, &ldquo;Do you know, Grog, I don't feel quite comfortable here.
Rather mixed company, ain't it, for a fellow who only goes out of a
Sunday?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;All safe,&rdquo; muttered Davis. &ldquo;These all are bank directors or railway
swells. I wish we had the robbing of them!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good deal of humbug about all this, ain't there?&rdquo; whispered Beecher, as
he threw his eyes over the crowded room.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course there is,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;While he's keeping us all
kicking our shins here, he's reading the 'Times,' or gossiping with a
friend, or weighing a double letter for the post. It was the dentists took
up the dodge first, and the nobs followed them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'm not going to stand it much longer, Grog. I tell you I don't feel
comfortable.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stuff and nonsense! You don't fancy any of these chaps has a writ in his
pocket, do you? Why, I can tell you every man in the room. That little
fellow, with the punch-colored shorts, is chairman of the Royal Canal
Company. I know <i>him</i>, and he knows <i>me</i>. He had me 'up' about a
roulette-table on board of one of the boats, and if it had n't been for a
trifling incident that occurred to his wife at Boulogne, where she went
for the bathing, and which I broke to him in confidence&mdash;But stay,
he's coming over to speak to me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How d'ye do, Captain Davis?&rdquo; said the stranger, with the air of a man
resolved to brave a difficulty, while he threw into the manner a tone of
haughty patronage.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pretty bobbish, Mr. Hailes; and <i>you</i>, the same I hope.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, thank you. You never paid me that little visit you promised at
Leixlip.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 've been so busy of late; up to my ears, as they say. Going to start a
new company, and thinking of asking your assistance too.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What's the nature of it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, it's a kind of a mutual self-securing sort of thing against family
accidents. You understand,&mdash;a species of universal guarantee to
insure domestic peace and felicity,&mdash;a thing that will come home to
us all; and I only want a few good names in the direction, to give the
shares a push.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Beecher looked imploringly, to try and restrain him; but he went on,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;May I take the liberty to put you down on the committee of management?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Before any answer could come to this speech, Mr. Clowes called out in a
deep voice,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Annesley Beecher and Captain Davis;&rdquo; and flung wide the door for them
to pass out.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why did you say that to him, Grog?&rdquo; whispered Beecher, as they moved
along.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just because I was watching the way he looked at me. He had a hardy, bold
expression on his face that showed he needed a reminder, and so I gave him
one. Always have the first blow when you see a fellow means to strike
you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mr. Davenport Dunn rose as the visitors entered the' room, and having
motioned to them to be seated, took his place with his back to the fire,&mdash;a
significant intimation that he did not anticipate a lengthy review.
Whether it was that he had not previously settled in his own mind how to
open the object of his visit, or that something in Dunn's manner and
appearance unlike what he anticipated had changed his intention; but
certain is it that Beecher felt confused and embarrassed, and when
reminded by Dunn's saying, &ldquo;I am at your service, sir,&rdquo; he turned a most
imploring look towards Davis to come to his rescue. The captain, however,
with more tact, paid no attention to the appeal; and Beecher, with an
immense effort, stammered out, &ldquo;I have taken the liberty to call on you. I
have come here today in consequence of a letter&mdash;that is, my brother,
Lord Lackington&mdash;You know my brother?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have that honor, sir.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, in writing to me a few days back, he added a hurried postscript,
saying he had just seen you; that you were then starting for Ireland,
where, on your arrival, it would be well I should wait upon you at once.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Did his Lordship mention with what object, sir?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I can't exactly say that he did. He said something about your being his
man of business, thoroughly acquainted with all his affairs, and so, of
course, I expected&mdash;I believed, at least&mdash;that you might be able
to lead the way,&mdash;to show me the line of country, as one might call
it,&rdquo; added he, with a desperate attempt to regain his ease by recurring to
his favorite phraseology.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Really, sir, my engagements are so numerous that I have to throw myself
on the kindness of those who favor me with a call to explain the object of
their visit.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I haven't got Lackington's letter about me; but if I remember aright, all
he said was, 'See Dunn as soon as you can, and he 'll put you up to a
thing or two,' or words to that effect.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I regret deeply, sir, that the expressions give me no clew to the matter
in hand.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If this ain't fencing, my name isn't Davis,&rdquo; said Grog, breaking in. &ldquo;You
know well, without any going about the bush, what he comes about; and all
this skirmishing is only to see if he's as well 'up' as yourself in his
own business. Now then, no more chaff, but go in at once.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;May I ask who is this gentleman?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A friend,&mdash;a very particular friend of mine,&rdquo; said Beecher, quickly,&mdash;&ldquo;Captain
Davis.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Captain Davis,&rdquo; repeated Dunn, in a half voice to himself, as if to
assist his memory to some effort,&mdash;&ldquo;Captain Davis.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Grog, defiantly,&mdash;&ldquo;Captain Davis.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Does his Lordship's letter mention I should have the honor of a call from
Captain Davis, sir?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; but as he's my own intimate friend,&mdash;a gentleman who possesses
all my confidence,&mdash;I thought, indeed, I felt, the importance of
having his advice upon any questions that might arise in this interview.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'm afraid, sir, you have subjected your friend to a most unprofitable
inconvenience.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The match postponed till further notice,&rdquo; whispered Grog.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I beg pardon, sir,&rdquo; said Dunn, not overhearing the remark.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was a saying that no race would come off to-day, in consequence of the
inclemency of the weather,&rdquo; said Grog, as he adjusted his shirt collar.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Am I to conclude, then,&rdquo; said Beecher, &ldquo;that you have not any
communication to make to me?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, you ain't,&rdquo; broke in Grog, quickly. &ldquo;He don't like me, that's all,
and he has n't the manliness to say it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;On the contrary, sir, I feel all the advantage of your presence on this
occasion, all the benefit of that straightforward manner of putting the
question which saves us so much valuable time.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Grog bowed an acknowledgment of the compliment, but with a grin on his
face that showed in what spirit he accepted it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Lord Lackington did not speak to you about my allowance?&rdquo; asked Beecher,
losing all patience.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, sir, not a word.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He did not allude to a notion&mdash;he did not mention a plan&mdash;he
did not discuss people called O'Reilly, did he?&rdquo; asked he, growing more
and more confused and embarrassed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not a syllable with reference to such a name escaped him, sir.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Don't you see,&rdquo; said Grog, rising, &ldquo;that you 'll have to look for the
explanation to the second column of the 'Times,' where 'A. B. will hear
something to his advantage if he calls without C.D.'?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Davenport Dunn paid no attention to this remark, but stood calmly
impassive before them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It comes to this, then, that Lackington has been hoaxing me,&rdquo; said
Beecher, rising, with an expression of ill-temper on his face.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I should rather suggest another possibility,&rdquo; said Dunn, politely; &ldquo;that,
knowing how far his Lordship has graciously reposed his own confidence in
me, he has generously extended to me the chance of obtaining the same
position of trust on the part of his brother,&mdash;an honor I am most
ambitious to attain. If you are disengaged on Sunday next,&rdquo; added he, in a
low voice, &ldquo;and would favor me with your company at dinner, alone,&mdash;quite
alone&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Beecher bowed an assent in silence, casting a cautious glance towards
Davis, who was scanning the contents of the morning paper.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Till then,&rdquo; muttered Dunn, while he added aloud, &ldquo;A good-morning,&rdquo; and
bowed them both to the door.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, you are a soft un, there's no denying it,&rdquo; said Davis, as they
gained the street.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What d'ye mean?&rdquo; cried Beecher, angrily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, don't you see how you spoiled all? I'd have had the whole story out
of him, but you would n't give me time to 'work the oracle.' He only
wanted to show us how cunning he was,&mdash;that he was deep and all that;
and when he saw that we were all wonder and amazement about his
shrewdness, then he 'd have gone to business.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not a bit of it, Master Grog; that fellow's wide awake, I tell you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So much the worse for you, then, that's all.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Because you're a going to dine with him on Sunday next, all alone. I
heard it, though you did n't think I was listening, and I saw the look
that passed, too, as much as to say, 'We 'll not have that fellow;' and
that's the reason I say, 'So much the worse for you.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, what can he do, with all his craft? He can't make me put my name to
paper; and if he did, much good would it do him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>You</i> can't make running against the like of him,&rdquo; said Grog,
contemptuously. &ldquo;He has an eye in his head like a dog-fox. <i>You</i> 've
no chance with him. He could n't double on me,&mdash;he 'd not try it; but
he 'll play <i>you</i> like a trout in a fish-pond.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What if I send him an excuse, then,&mdash;shall I do that?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No. You must go, if it was only to show that you suspect nothing; but
keep your eyes open, watch the ropes, and come over to me when the 'heat
is run.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And with this counsel they parted.

<h2>
CHAPTER XVII. THE &ldquo;PENSIONNAT GODARDE.&rdquo;
 </h2>
<p>
Let us ask our reader to turn for a brief space from these scenes and
these actors, and accompany us to that rich plain which stretches to the
northwest of Brussels, and where, on the slope of the gentle hill, beneath
the royal palace of Lacken, stands a most picturesque old house, known as
the Château of the Three Fountains. The very type of a château of the Low
Countries, from its gabled fronts, all covered with festooned
rhododendron, to its trim gardens, peopled with leaden deities and
ornamented by the three fountains to which it owes its name, nothing was
wanting. From the plump little figure who blew his trumpet on the
weather-vane, to the gaudily gilded pleasure-boat that peeped from amidst
the tall water-lilies of the fish-pond, all proclaimed the peculiar taste
of a people who loved to make nature artificial, and see the instincts of
their own quaint natures reproduced in every copse and hedgerow around
them.
</p>
<p>
All the little queer contrivances of Dutch ingenuity were there,&mdash;mock
shrubs, which blossomed as you touched a spring; jets, that spurted out as
you trod on a certain spot; wooden figures, worked by mechanisms, lowered
the drawbridge to let you pass; nor was the toll-keeper forgotten, who
touched his cap in salutation. Who were they who had designed all these
pleasant conceits, and what fate had fallen on their descendants, we know
not. At the time we speak of, the château was a select Pensionnat for ten
young ladies, presided over by Madame Godarde, &ldquo;of whom all particulars
might be learned at Cadel's Library, Old Bond Street, or by personal
application to the Rev. Pierre Faucher, Evangelical Minister, Adam Street,
Strand, London.&rdquo; It was, as we have said, select,&mdash;the most select of
Pensionnats. The ten young ladies were chosen after investigations the
most scrutinizing; the conditions of the admission verged on the
impossible. The mistress realized in her person all the rare attributes of
an elevated rank and a rigid Protestantism, while the educational
programme was little short of a fellowship course. Just as being a
guardsman is supposed to confer a certain credit over a man's outset in
life, it was meant that being an <i>élève</i> of Madame Godarde should
enter the world with a due and becoming <i>prestige</i>; for while the
range of acquirements included something at least from every branch of
human science, the real superiority and strength of the establishment lay
in the moral culture observed there; and as the female teachers were
selected from amongst the models of the sex, the male instructors were
warranted as having triumphed over temptations not inferior to St.
Anthony's. The ritual of the establishment well responded to all the
difficulties of admission. It was almost conventual in strictness; and
even to the uniform dress worn by the pupils there was much that recalled
the nunnery. The quiet uniformity of an unbroken existence, the changeless
fashion of each day's life, impressed even young and buoyant hearts, and
toned down to seriousness spirits that nature had formed to be light and
joyous. One by one, they who had entered there underwent this change; a
little longer might be the struggle with some, the end was alike to all;
nay, not to all! there was one whose temperament resisted to the last, and
who, after three years of the durance, was just as unbroken in spirit,
just as high in heart, just as gay, as when she first crossed the
threshold. Gifted with one of those elastic natures which rise against
every pressure, she accepted every hardship as the occasion for fresh
resource, and met each new infliction, whether it were a severe task, or
even punishment, with a high-hearted resolve not to be vanquished. There
was nothing in her appearance that indicated this hardihood: she was a
fair, slight girl, whose features were feminine almost to childishness.
The gray-blue eyes, shaded with deep lashes; the beautifully formed mouth,
on which a half-saucy smile so often played; a half-timid expression
conveyed in the ever-changing color of her cheek,&mdash;suggested the
expression of a highly impressionable and undecided nature; yet this
frail, delicate girl, whose birdlike voice reminded one of childhood,
swayed and ruled all her companions. She added to these personal graces
abilities of a high order. Skilled in every accomplishment, she danced and
sang and drew and played better than her fellows; she spoke several modern
languages fluently, and even caught up their local dialects with a
quickness quite marvellous. She could warble the Venetian barcarole with
all the soft accents of an Adriatic tongue, or sing the Bauerlied of the
Tyrol with every cadence of the peasant's fancy. With a memory so
retentive that she could generally repeat what she had once read over
attentively, she had powers of mimicry that enabled her to produce at will
everything noticeable that crossed her. A vivid fancy, too, threw its
glittering light over all these faculties, so that even the commonplace
incidents of daily life grouped themselves dramatically in her mind, and
events the least striking were made the origin of situation and sentiment,
brilliant with wit and poetry.
</p>
<p>
<a name="linkimage-0008" id="linkimage-0008">
<!-- IMG --></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
<img src="images/10206.jpg" width="100%" alt="206 " />
</div>
<p>
Great as all these advantages were, they were aided, and not
inconsiderably, by other and adventitious ones. She was reputed to be a
great heiress. How and when and why this credit attached to her, it were
hard to say; assuredly she had never given it any impulse. She spoke,
indeed, constantly of her father&mdash;her only living relation&mdash;as
of one who never grudged her any indulgence, and she showed her
schoolfellows the handsome presents which from time to time he sent her;
these in their costliness&mdash;so unlike the gifts common to her age&mdash;may
possibly have assisted the belief in her great wealth. But however
founded, the impression prevailed that she was to be the possessor of
millions, and in the course of destiny, to be what her companions called
her in jest&mdash;a Princess.
</p>
<p>
Nor did the designation seem ill applied. Of all the traits her nature
exhibited, none seemed so conspicuous as that of &ldquo;birth.&rdquo; The admixture of
timidity and haughtiness, that blended gentleness with an air of command,
a certain instinctive acceptance of whatever deference was shown her as a
matter of right and due, all spoke of &ldquo;blood;&rdquo; and her walk, her voice,
her slightest gesture, were in keeping with this impression. Even they who
liked her least, and were most jealous of her fascination, never called
her Princess in any mockery. No, strange enough, the title was employed
with all the significance of respect, and as such did she receive it.
</p>
<p>
If it were not that, in her capricious moods, Nature has moulded stranger
counterfeits than this, we might incur some risk of incredulity from our
reader when we say that the Princess was no other than Grog Davis's
daughter!
</p>
<p>
Davis had been a man of stratagems from his very beginning in life. All
his gains had been acquired by dexterity and trick. Whatever he had
accomplished was won as at a game where some other paid the loss. His
mind, consequently, fashioned itself to the condition in which he lived,
and sharpness and shrewdness and over-reaching seemed to him not alone the
only elements of success, but the only qualities worth honoring. He had
seen honesty and imbecility so often in company that he thought them
convertible terms; and yet this man&mdash;&ldquo;leg,&rdquo; outcast, knave that he
was&mdash;rose above all the realities of a life of roguery in one
aspiration,&mdash;to educate his child in purity, to screen her from the
contamination of his own set, to bring her up amongst all the refining
influences of care and culture, and make her, as he said to himself, &ldquo;the
equal of the best lady in the land!&rdquo; To place her amongst the well-born
and wealthy, to have her where her origin could not be traced, where no
clew would connect her with himself, had cost him a greater exercise of
ingenuity than the deepest scheme he had ever plotted on the turf. That
exchange of references on which Madame Godarde's exclusiveness so
peremptorily insisted was only to be met at heavy cost. The distinguished
baronet who stood sponsor to Grog Davis's respectability received cash for
the least promising of promissory notes in return, and the lady who waited
on Madame Godarde in her brougham &ldquo;to make acquaintance with the person
who was to have charge of her young relative,&rdquo; was the distracted mother
of a foolish young man who had given bills to Davis for several thousands,
and who by this special mission obtained possession of the documents. In
addition to these direct, there were many other indirect sacrifices. Grog
was obliged for a season to forego all the habits and profits of his daily
life, to live in a sort of respectable seclusion, his servants in
mourning, and himself in the deepest sable for the loss of a wife who had
died twelve years before. In fact, he had to take out a species of moral
naturalization, the details of which seemed interminable, and served to
convince him that respectability was not the easy, indolent thing he had
hitherto imagined it.
</p>
<p>
If Davis had been called on to furnish a debtor and creditor account of
the transaction, the sum spent in the accomplishment of this feat would
have astonished his assignee. As he said himself, &ldquo;Fifteen hundred would
n't see him through it.&rdquo; It is but fair to say that the amount so
represented comprised the very worst of bad debts, but Grog cared little
for that; his theory was that there was n't the difference between a
guinea and a pound in the best bill from Baring's and the worst paper in
Holywell Street. &ldquo;You can always get either your money or your money's
worth,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and very frequently the last is the better of the two.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
If it was a proud day for the father as he consigned his daughter to
Madame Godarde's care, it was no less a happy one for Lizzy Davis, as she
found herself in the midst of companions of her own age, and surrounded
with all the occupations and appliances of a life of elegance. Brought up
from infancy in a small school in a retired part of Cornwall, she had only
known her father during the two or three off months of that probationary
course of respectability we have alluded to. With all his affection for
his child, and every desire to give it utterance, Davis was so conscious
of his own defects in education, and the blemishes which his tone of mind
and thought would inevitably exhibit, that he had to preserve a sort of
estrangement towards her, and guard himself against whatever might
prejudice him in her esteem. If, then, by a thousand acts of kindness and
liberality he gained on her affection, there was that in his cold and
distant manner that as totally repelled all confidence. To escape from the
dull uniformity of that dreary home, where a visitor never entered, nor
any intercourse with the world was maintained, to a scene redolent of
life, with gay light-hearted associates, all pursuing the same sunny
paths, to engage her brilliant faculties in a variety of congenial
pursuits, wherein there was only so much of difficulty as inspired zeal,
to enter on an existence wherein each day imparted the sense of new
acquirement, was a happiness that verged on ecstasy. It needed not all the
flatteries that surrounded her to make this seem a paradise; but she had
these, too, and in so many ways. Some loved her light-heartedness, and
that gay spirit that floated like an atmosphere about her; others praised
her gracefulness and her beauty; some preferred to these, those versatile
gifts of mind that gave her the mastery over whatever she desired to
learn; and there were those who dwelt on the great fortune she was to
have, and the great destiny that awaited her.
</p>
<p>
How often in the sportive levity of happy girlhood had they asked her what
life she should choose for herself,&mdash;what station, and what land to
live in! They questioned her in all sincerity, believing she had but to
wish, to have the existence that pleased her. Then what tender caresses
followed,&mdash;what flattering entreaties that the dear Princess would
not forget Josephine or Gertrude or Julia, in the days of her greatness,
but would recognize those who had been her loved schoolfellows years
before!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What a touchstone of your tact will it be, Lizzy, when you 're a
duchess,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;to meet one of us in a watering-place or on a
steamboat, and to explain, delicately enough, not to hurt us, to his Grace
the Duke that you knew us as girls, and how provoking if you should call
me Jane or Clara!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And then the charming condescension of your inquiry if we were married,
though a half-bashful and an awkward-looking man should be standing by at
our interview, waiting to be presented, and afraid to be spoken to. Or
worse than that, the long, terrible pauses in conversation, which show how
afraid you are lest we should tumble into reminiscences.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Lizzy darling,&rdquo; cried another, &ldquo;do be a duchess for a moment, and
show how you would treat us all. It would be charming.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You seem to be forgetting, mesdames,&rdquo; said she, haughtily, &ldquo;what an
upstart you are making of me. This wondrous elevation, which is at once to
make me forget my friends and myself, does not present to my eyes the same
dazzling effect. In fact, I can imagine myself a duchess to-morrow without
losing either my self-respect or my memory.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Daisy dearest, do not be angry with us,&rdquo; cried one, addressing her by the
pet name which they best loved to call her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am rather angry with myself that I should leave no better impression
behind me. Yes,&rdquo; added she, in a tone of sadness, &ldquo;I am going away.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, darling Lizzy,&mdash;oh, Daisy, don't say so,&rdquo; broke out so many
voices together.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Too true! dearest friends,&rdquo; said she, throwing her arms around those
nearest to her. &ldquo;I only learned it this morning. Madame Godarde came to my
room to say papa had written for me, and would come over to fetch me in
about a fortnight I ought doubtless to be so happy at the prospect of
going home; but I have no mother,&mdash;I have not either brother or
sister; and here, amidst you, I have every tie that can attach the heart.
When shall I ever live again amidst such loving hearts?&mdash;when shall
life be the happy dream I have felt it here?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But think of us, Daisy, forlorn and deserted,&rdquo; cried one, sobbing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Lizzy,&rdquo; broke in another, &ldquo;imagine the day-by-day disappointments
that will break on us as we discover that this pleasure or that spot owed
its charm to you,&mdash;that it was your voice made the air melody, your
accents gave the words their feeling! Fancy us as we find out&mdash;as
find out we must&mdash;that the affection we bore you bound us into one
sisterhood&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; burst Lizzy in, &ldquo;do let me carry away some of my heart to him who
should have it all, and make not my last moments with you too painful to
bear. Remember, too, that it is but a passing separation; we can and we
will write to each other. I 'll never weary of hearing all about you and
this dear spot. There's not a rosebud opening to the morning air but will
bring some fragrance to my heart; and that dear old window! how often
shall I sit at it in fancy, and look over the fair plain before us.
Bethink you, too, that I am only the first launched into that wide ocean
of life where we are all to meet hereafter.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And be the dear, dear friends we now are,&rdquo; cried another. And so they
hung upon her neck and kissed her, bathing her soft tresses with their
tears, and indulging in all the rapture of that sorrow no ecstasy of joy
can equal.

<h2>
CHAPTER XVIII. SOME DOINGS OF MR. DRISCOLL.
</h2>
<p>
&ldquo;There it is, Bella,&rdquo; said Kellett, as he entered the cottage at
nightfall, and threw a sealed letter on the table. &ldquo;I hadn't the courage
to open it. A fellow came into the office and said, 'Is one Kellett here?
This is a letter from Mr. Davenport Dunn.' <i>He</i> was Mister, and <i>I</i>
was <i>one</i> Kellett. Wasn't I low enough when I couldn't say a word to
it?&mdash;wasn't I down-in the world when I had to bear it in silence?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Shall I read it for you?&rdquo; said she, gently.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do, darling; but before you begin, give me a glass of whiskey-and-water.
I want courage for it, and something tells me, Bella, I'll need courage
too.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come, come, papa, this is not like yourself; this is not the old Albuera
spirit you are so justly proud of.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Five-and-thirty years' hard struggling with the world never improved a
man's pluck. There was n't a fellow in the Buffs had more life in him than
Paul Kellett. It was in general orders never to sell my traps or camp
furniture when I was reported missing; for, as General Pack said, 'Kellett
is sure to turn up to-morrow or the day after.' And look at me now!&rdquo; cried
he, bitterly; &ldquo;and as to selling me out, they don't show me much mercy,
Bella, do they?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She made no reply, but slowly proceeded to break the seal of the letter.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What a hurry ye're in to read bad news!&rdquo; cried he, peevishly; &ldquo;can't you
wait till I finish this?&rdquo; And he pointed to the glass, which he sipped
slowly, like one wishing to linger over it.
</p>
<p>
A half-melancholy smile was all her answer, and he went on,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm as sure of what's in that letter there as if I read it. Now, mark my
words, and I'll just tell you the contents of it: Kellett's Court is sold,
the first sale confirmed, and the Master's report on your poor mother's
charge is unfavorable. There's not a perch of the old estate left us, and
we're neither more nor less than beggars. There it is for you in plain
English.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let us learn the worst at once, then,&rdquo; said she, resolutely, as she
opened the letter.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who told you that was the worst?&rdquo; broke he in, angrily. &ldquo;The worst isn't
over for the felon in the dock when the judge has finished the sentence;
there's the 'drop' to come, after that.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Father, father!&rdquo; cried she, pitifully, &ldquo;be yourself again. Remember what
you said the other night, that if we had poor Jack back again you'd not be
afraid to face life in some new world beyond the seas, and care little for
hardships or humble fortune if we could only be together.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was dreaming, I suppose,&rdquo; muttered he, doggedly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; you were speaking out of the fulness of your love and affection; you
were showing me how little the accidents of fortune touch the happiness of
those resolved to walk humbly, and that, once divested of that repining
spirit which was ever recalling the past, we should confront the life
before us more light of heart than we have felt for many a year.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wonder what put it in my head,&rdquo; muttered he, in the same despondent
tone.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your own stout heart put it there. You were recalling what young Conway
was telling us about poor Jack's plans and projects; and how, when the war
was over, he 'd get the Sultan to grant him a patch of land close to the
Bosphorus, where he'd build a little kiosk for us all, and we 'd grow our
own corn and have our own vines and fig-trees, seeking for nothing but
what our own industry should give us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Dreams, dreams!&rdquo; said he, sighing drearily. &ldquo;You may read the letter
now.&rdquo; And she began,&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Sir,&mdash;By direction of Mr. Davenport Dunn, I have to
acquaint you that the Commissioners, having overruled the
objections submitted by him, will on Tuesday next proceed to
the sale of the lands of Kellett's Court, Gorestown, and
Kilinaganny, free of all charges and encumbrances thereon,
whether by marriage settlement&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
&ldquo;I told you,&mdash;that's just what I was saying,&rdquo; burst in Kellett;
&ldquo;there's not sixpence left us!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She ran hurriedly over to herself the tiresome intricacies that followed,
till she came to the end, where a brief postscript ran,&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;As your name is amongst those to be reduced in consequence
of the late Treasury order regarding the Customs, Mr. Dunn
hopes you will lose no time in providing yourself with
another employment, to which end he will willingly
contribute any aid in his power.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
A wild, hysterical burst of laughter broke from Kellett as she ceased.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Isn't there any more good news, Bella? Look over it carefully, darling,
and you 'll surely discover something else.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The terrible expression of his face shocked her, and she could make no
reply.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'll wager a crown, if you search well, you 'll see something about
sending me to jail, or, maybe, transporting me.&mdash;Who's that knocking
at the door there?&rdquo; cried he, angrily, as a very loud noise resounded
through the little cottage.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;'T is a gentleman without wants to speak to the master,&rdquo; said the old
woman, entering.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'm engaged, and can't see anybody,&rdquo; rejoined Kellett, sternly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He says it's the same if he could see Miss Bella,&rdquo; reiterated the old
woman.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He can't, then; she 's engaged too.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The woman still lingered at the door, as if she expected some change of
purpose.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Don't you hear me?&mdash;don't you understand what I said?&rdquo; cried he,
passionately.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Tell him that your master cannot see him,&rdquo; said Bella.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If I don't make too bould,&mdash;if it's not too free of me,&mdash;maybe
you 'd excuse the liberty I 'm taking,&rdquo; said a man, holding the door
slightly open, and projecting a round bullet head and a very red face into
the room.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Driscoll,&rdquo; cried Bella. &ldquo;Mrs. Hawkshaw's brother, papa,&rdquo;
 whispered she, quietly, to her father, who, notwithstanding the
announcement, made no sign.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If Captain Kellett would pardon my intrusion,&rdquo; said Driscoll, entering
with a most submissive air, &ldquo;he'd soon see that it was at laste with good
intentions I came out all the way here on foot, and a bad night besides,&mdash;a
nasty little drizzling rain and mud,&mdash;such mud!&rdquo; And he held up in
evidence a foot about the size of an elephant's.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pray sit down, Mr. Driscoll,&rdquo; said Bella, placing a chair for him. &ldquo;Papa
was engaged with matters of business when you knocked,&mdash;some letters
of consequence.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, miss, to be sure, and did n't want to be disturbed,&rdquo; said Driscoll,
as he sat down, and wiped his heated forehead. &ldquo;I 'm often the same way
myself; but when I 'm at home, and want nobody to disturb me, I put on a
little brown-paper cap I have, and that's the sign no one's to talk to
me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Kellett burst into a laugh at the conceit, and Driscoll so artfully joined
in the emotion that when it ceased they were already on terms of intimacy.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You see what a strange crayture I am. God help me!&rdquo; said Driscoll,
sighing. &ldquo;I have to try as many dodges with myself as others does be using
with the world, for my poor head goes wanderin' away about this, that, and
the other, and I 'm never sure it will think of what I want.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's a sad case,&rdquo; said Kellett, compassionately.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was like everybody else tell I had the fever,&rdquo; continued Driscoll,
confidentially. &ldquo;It was the spotted fever, not the scarlet fever, d' ye
mind; and when I came out of it on the twenty-ninth day, I was the same as
a child, simple and innocent You 'd laugh now if I told you what I did
with the first half-crown I got. I bought a bag of marbles!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And Kellett did laugh heartily; less, perhaps, at the circumstance than at
the manner and look of him who told it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, faith, marbles!&rdquo; muttered Driscoll to himself; &ldquo;'tis a game I'm
mighty fond of.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Will you take a little whiskey-and-water? Hot or cold?&rdquo; asked Kellett,
courteously.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just a taste, to take off the deadness of the water,&rdquo; said Driscoll. &ldquo;I
'm obleeged to be as cautious as if I was walkin' on eggs. Dr. Dodd says
to me, 'Terry,' says he, 'you had never much brains in your best days, but
now you 're only a sheet of thin paper removed from an idiot, and if you
touch spirits it's all up with you.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That was plain speaking, anyhow,&rdquo; said Kellett, smiling.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Driscoll, while he seemed struggling to call up some
reminiscence: and then, having succeeded, said, &ldquo;Ay, 'There's
five-and-twenty in Swift's this minute,' said he, 'with their heads
shaved, and in blue cotton dressing-gowns, more sensible than yourself.'
But, you see, there was one thing in my favor,&mdash;I was always
harmless.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The compassionate expression with which Kellett listened to this
declaration guaranteed how completely the speaker had engaged his
sympathy.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; continued Driscoll, &ldquo;maybe I'm just as happy, ay, happier
than ever I was! Every one is kind and good-natured to me now. Nobody
takes offence at what I say or do; they know well in their hearts that I
don't mean any harm.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That you don't,&rdquo; broke in Bella, whose gratitude for many a passing word
of kindness, as he met her of a morning, willingly seized upon the
opportunity for acknowledgment.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My daughter has often told me of the kind way you always spoke to her.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Think of that, now,&rdquo; muttered Terry to himself; &ldquo;and I saying all the
while to my own heart, ''T is a proud man you ought to be to-day, Terry
Driscoll, to be giving good-morning to Miss Kellett of Kellett's Court,
the best ould blood in your own county.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your health, Driscoll,&mdash;your health,&rdquo; cried Kellett, warmly. &ldquo;Let
your head be where it will, your heart's in the right place, anyhow.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you say so, now?&rdquo; asked he, with all the eagerness of one putting a
most anxious question.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I do, and I 'd swear it,&rdquo; cried Kellett, resolutely. &ldquo;'Tis too clever and
too 'cute the world's grown; they were better times when there was more
good feeling and less learning.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed&mdash;indeed, it was the remark I made to my sister Mary the night
before last,&rdquo; broke in Driscoll. &ldquo;'What is there,' says I, 'that Miss
Kellett can't teach them? They know the rule of three and What
's-his-name's Questions as well as I know my prayers. You don't want them
to learn mensuration and the use of the globes?' 'I 'll send them to a
school in France,' says she; 'it's the only way to be genteel.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To a school in France?&rdquo; cried Bella; &ldquo;and is that really determined on?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, miss; they 're to go immediately, and ye see that was the reason I
walked out here in the rain to-night I said to myself, 'Terry,' says I,
'they 'll never say a word about this to Miss Kellett till the quarter is
up; be off, now, and break it to her at once.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was so like your own kind heart,&rdquo; burst out Bella.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; muttered Driscoll, as if in a revery, &ldquo;that's the only good o' me
now,&mdash;I can think of what will be of use to others.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Did n't I tell you we were in a vein of good luck, Bella?&rdquo; said Kellett,
between his teeth; &ldquo;didn't I say awhile ago there was more coming?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;'But,' says I to Mary,&rdquo; continued Driscoll, &ldquo;'you must take care to
recommend Miss Kellett among your friends&mdash;'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Kellett dashed his glass down with such force on the table as to frighten
Driscoll, whose speech was thus abruptly cut short, and the two men sat
staring fixedly at each other. The expression of poor Terry's vacant face,
in which a struggling effort to deprecate anger was the solitary emotion
readable, so overcame Kellett's passion that, stooping over, he grasped
the other's hand warmly, and said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You 're a kind-hearted creature, and you 'd never hurt a living soul. I
'm not angry with you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thank you, Captain Kellett,&mdash;thank you,&rdquo; cried the other, hurriedly,
and wiped his brow, like one vainly endeavoring to follow out a chain of
thought collectedly. &ldquo;Who is this told me that you had another daughter?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Kellett; &ldquo;I have a son.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, to be sure! so it was a son, they said, and a fine strapping young
fellow too. Where is he?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He 's with his regiment, the Rifles, in the Crimea.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Dear me, now, to think of that,&mdash;fighting the French, just the way
his father did.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Kellett, smiling, &ldquo;it 's the Russians he 's fighting, and the
French are helping him to do it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's better any day,&rdquo; said Driscoll; &ldquo;two to one is a pleasanter match.
And so he's in the Rifles?&rdquo; And here he laid his head on his hand and
seemed lost in thought. &ldquo;Is he a captain?&rdquo; asked he, after a long pause.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, not yet,&rdquo; said Kellett, while his cheek flushed at the evasion he was
practising.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, maybe he will soon,&rdquo; resumed the other, relapsing once more into
deep thought. &ldquo;There was a young fellow joined them in Cork just before
they sailed, and I lent him thirty shillings, and he never paid me. I
wonder what became of him? Maybe he's killed.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just as likely,&rdquo; said Kellett, carelessly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now, would your son be able to make him out for me?&mdash;not for the
sake of the money, for I would n't speak of it, but out of regard for him,
for I took a liking to him; he was a fine, handsome fellow, and bold as a
lion.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He mightn't be in Jack's battalion, or he might, and Jack not know him.
What was his name?&rdquo; said Kellett, in some confusion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'll tell you if you 'll pledge your word you 'll never say a syllable
about the money, for I can't think but he forgot it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'll never breathe a word about it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And will you ask your son all about him,&mdash;if he likes the sarvice,
or if he 'd rather be at home, and how it agrees with him?&rdquo; &ldquo;And the
name?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The name?&mdash;I wrote it down on a bit of paper just for my own
memory's sake, for I forget everything; the name is Conway,&mdash;Charles
Conway.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, that's the very&mdash;&rdquo; When he got so far, a warning look from
Bella arrested Kellett's voice, and he ceased speaking, looking eagerly at
his daughter for some explanation. Had he not been so anxious for some
clew to her meaning, he could scarcely have failed to be struck by the
intense keenness of the glance Driscoll turned from the countenance of the
father to that of the daughter. She, however, marked it, and with such
significance that a deathlike sickness crept suddenly over her, and she
sank slowly down into a seat.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You ware saying, 'That's the very&mdash;'&rdquo; said Driscoll, repeating the
words, and waiting for the conclusion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The very name we read in a newspaper,&rdquo; said Bella, who, with a sort of
vague instinct of some necessity for concealment, at once gave this
evasive reply. &ldquo;He volunteered for somewhere, or was first inside a
battery, or did something or other very courageous.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was n't killed he was?&rdquo; said Driscoll, in his habitual tone.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried Kellett, &ldquo;he was all safe.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Isn't it a queer thing? but I'd like to hear of him! There was some
Conway s connections of my mother's, and I can't get it out of my head but
he might be one of them. It's not a common name, like Driscoll.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, Jack will, maybe, be able to tell you about him,&rdquo; said Kellett,
still under the spell of Bella's caution.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If you would tell me on what points you want to be informed,&rdquo; said Bella,
&ldquo;I shall be writing to my brother in a day or two. Are there any distinct
questions you wish to be answered?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The calm but searching glance that accompanied these few words gradually
gave way to an expression of pity as Bella gazed at the hopeless
imbecility of poor Driscoll's face, wherein not a gleam of intelligence
now lingered. It was as if the little struggle of intellect had so
exhausted him that he was incapable of any further effort of reason. And
there he sat, waiting till the returning tide of thought should flow back
upon his stranded intelligence.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Would you like him to be questioned about the family?&rdquo; said she, looking
good-naturedly at him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, miss,&mdash;yes,&rdquo; said he, half dreamily; &ldquo;that is, I would n't like
my own name, poor crayture as I am, to be mentioned; but if you could
anyways find out if he was one of the Conway s of Abergedley,&mdash;they
were my mother's people,&mdash;if you could find out that for me, it would
be a great comfort.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'll charge myself with the commission,&rdquo; said Bella, writing down the
words &ldquo;Conway of Abergedley.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now there was something else, if my poor head could only remember it,&rdquo;
 said Driscoll, whose countenance displayed the most complete picture of a
puzzled intelligence.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mix yourself another tumbler, and you'll think of it by and by,&rdquo; said
Kellett, courteously.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; muttered Driscoll, accepting the suggestion at once. &ldquo;It was
something about mustard-seed, I think,&rdquo; added he, after a pause; &ldquo;they say
it will keep fresh for two years if you put it in a blue-paper bag,&mdash;deep
blue is best&rdquo; A look of sincere compassion passed between Kellett and his
daughter, and Driscoll went on, &ldquo;I don't think it was that, though, I
wanted to remember.&rdquo; And he fell into deep reflection for several minutes,
at the end of which he started abruptly up, finished off his glass, and
began to button up his coat in preparation for the road.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Don't go till I see what the night looks like,&rdquo; cried Kellett, as he left
the room to examine the state of the weather.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If I should be fortunate enough to obtain any information, how shall I
communicate with you?&rdquo; asked Bella, addressing him hastily, as if to
profit by the moment of their being alone.
</p>
<p>
Driscoll looked fixedly at her for a second or two, and gradually the
expression of his face settled down into its habitual cast of unmeaning
imbecility, while he merely muttered to himself, &ldquo;No evidence; throw out
the bills.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She repeated her question, and in a voice to show that she believed
herself well understood.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said he, with a vacant grin,&mdash;&ldquo;yes! but they don't agree with
everybody.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There's a bit of a moon out now, and the rain has stopped,&rdquo; said Kellett,
entering, &ldquo;so that it would n't be friendly to detain you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good-night, good-night,&rdquo; said Driscoll, hurriedly; &ldquo;that spirit is got up
to my head. I feel it. A pleasant journey to you both, and be sure to
remember me to Mrs. Miller.&rdquo; And with these incoherent words he hastened
away, and his voice was soon heard singing cheerily as he plodded his way
towards Dublin. &ldquo;That's the greatest affliction of all,&rdquo; said Kellett, as
he sat down and sipped his glass. &ldquo;There 's nothing like having one's
faculties, one's reason, clear and unclouded. I would n't be like that
poor fellow there to be as rich as the Duke of Leinster.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is a strange condition,&rdquo; said Bella, thoughtfully. &ldquo;There were moments
when his eyes lighted up with a peculiar significance, as if, at
intervals, his mind had regained all its wonted vigor. Did you remark
that?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed, I did not. I saw nothing of the kind,&rdquo; said Kellett, peevishly.
&ldquo;By the way, why were you so cautious about Conway?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just because he begged that his name might not be mentioned. He said that
some trifling debts were still hanging over him, from his former
extravagance; and though all in course of liquidation, he dreaded the
importunate appeals of creditors so certain to pour in if they heard of
his being in Dublin.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Every one has his troubles!&rdquo; muttered Kellett, as he sank into a moody
reflection over his own, and sipped his liquor in silence.
</p>
<p>
Let us now follow Driscoll, who, having turned the corner of the lane, out
of earshot of the cottage, suddenly ceased his song, and walked briskly
along towards town. Rapidly as he walked, his lips moved more rapidly
still, as he maintained a kind of conversation with himself, bursting out
from time to time with a laugh, as some peculiar conceit amused him. &ldquo;To
be sure, a connection by the mother's side,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;One has a right to
ask after his own relations! And, for all I know, my grandmother was a
Conway. The ould fool was so near pokin' his foot in it, and letting out
that he knew him well. She's a deep one, that daughter; and it was a bould
stroke the way she spoke to me when we were alone. It was just as much as
to say, 'Terry, put your cards down, for I know your hand.' 'No, miss,'
says I, 'I've a thrump in the heel of my fist that ye never set eyes on.
Ha, ha, ha!' but she's deep for all that,&mdash;mighty deep; and if it was
safe, I wish we had her in the plot! Ay! but is it safe, Mr. Driscoll? By
the virtue of your oath, Terry Driscoll, do you belave she wouldn't turn
on you? She's a fine-looking girl, too,&rdquo; added he, after an interval. &ldquo;I
wish I knew her sweetheart, for she surely has one. Terry, Terry, ye must
bestir yourself; ye must be up early and go to bed late, my boy. You 're
not the man ye were before ye had that 'faver,'&mdash;that spotted faver!&rdquo;&mdash;here
he laughed till his eyes ran over. &ldquo;What a poor crayture it has left ye;
no memory, no head for anything!&rdquo; And he actually shook with laughter at
the thought. &ldquo;Poor Terry Driscoll, ye are to be pitied!&rdquo; said he, as he
wiped the tears from his face. &ldquo;Is n't it a sin and a shame there's no one
to look after ye?&rdquo;

CHAPTER XIX. DRISCOLL IN CONFERENCE
</h2>
<p>
&ldquo;Not come in yet, sir; but he is sure to be back soon,&rdquo; said Mr. Clowes,
the butler, to Terry Driscoll, as he stood in the hall of Mr. Davenport
Dunn's house, about eleven o'clock of the same night we have spoken of in
our last chapter.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You're expecting him, then?&rdquo; asked Driscoll, in his own humble manner.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Clowes, looking at his watch; &ldquo;he ought to be here now.
We have a deal of business to get through to-night, and several
appointments to keep; but he'll see you, Mr. Driscoll. He always gives
directions to admit <i>you</i> at once.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Does he really?&rdquo; asked Driscoll, with an air of perfect innocence.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Clowes, in a tone at once easy and patronizing, &ldquo;he likes <i>you</i>.
You are one of the very few who can amuse him. Indeed, I don't think I
ever heard him laugh, what I 'd call a hearty laugh, except when you 're
with him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Isn't that quare, now!&rdquo; exclaimed Driscoll. &ldquo;Lord knows it's little fun
is in me now!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come in and take a chair; charge you nothing for the sitting,&rdquo; said
Clowes, laughing at his own smartness as he led the way into a most
comfortably furnished little room which formed his own sanctum.
</p>
<p>
The walls were decorated with colored prints and drawings of great
projected enterprises,&mdash;peat fuel manufactories of splendid
pretensions, American packet stations on the west coast, of almost regal
architecture, vied with ground-plans of public parks and ornamental model
farms; fish-curing institutions, and smelting-houses, and beetroot-sugar
buildings, graced scenes of the very wildest desolation, and, by an active
representation of life and movement, seemed to typify the wealth and
prosperity which enterprise was sure to carry into regions the very
dreariest and least promising.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A fine thing, that, Mr. Driscoll!&rdquo; said Clowes, as Terry stood admiring a
large and highly colored plate, wherein several steam-engines were
employed in supplying mill-streams with water from a vast lake, while
thousands of people seemed busily engaged in spade labor on its borders.
&ldquo;That is the 'Lough Corrib Drainage and Fresh Strawberry Company,' capital
eight hundred thousand pounds! Chemical analysis has discovered that the
soil of drained lands, treated with a suitable admixture of the alkaline
carbonates, is peculiarly favorable to the growth of the strawberry,&mdash;a
fruit whose properties are only now receiving their proper estimate. The
strawberry, you are perhaps not aware, is a great anti-scorbutic. Six
strawberries, taken in a glass of diluted malic acid of a morning,
fasting, would restore the health of those fine fellows we are now daily
losing in such numbers in the Crimea. I mean, of course, a regular
treatment of three months of this regimen, with due attention to diet,
cleanliness, and habit of exercise,&mdash;all predisposing elements
removed, all causes of mental anxiety withdrawn. To this humane discovery
this great industrial speculation owes its origin. There you see the
engines at full work; the lake is in process of being drained, the water
being all utilized by the mills you see yonder, some of which are
compressing the strawberry pulp into a paste for exportation. Here are the
people planting the shoots; those men in blue, with the watering-pots, are
the alkaline feeders, who supply the plant with the chemical preparation I
mentioned, the strength being duly marked by letters, as you see. B. C. P.
means bi-carbonate of potash; S. C. S., sub-carbonate of soda; and so on.
Already, sir,&rdquo; said he, raising his voice, &ldquo;we have contracts for the
supply of twenty-eight tons a week, and we hope,&rdquo; added he, with a
tremulous fervor in his voice, &ldquo;to live to see the time when the table of
the poorest peasant in the land will be graced by the health-conducing
condiment.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;With all my heart and soul I wish you success,&rdquo; said Driscoll; while he
muttered under his breath what sounded like a fervid prayer for the
realization of this blessed hope.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of that we are pretty certain, sir,&rdquo; said Clowes, pompously; &ldquo;the shares
are now one hundred and twelve,&mdash;paid up in two calls, thirty-six
pounds ten shillings, <i>He</i>,&rdquo; said Clowes, with a jerk of his thumb
towards Mr. Dunn's room, meant to indicate its owner,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>he</i>
don't like it; calls it a bubble, and all that, but I have, known him
mistaken, sir,&mdash;ay, and more than once. You may remember that vein of
yellow marble&mdash;giallo antico, they call it&mdash;found on Martin's
property&mdash;That's his knock; here he comes now,&rdquo; cried he, hurrying
away to meet his master, and leaving the story of his blunder unrelated.
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Clowes, re-entering, hastily; &ldquo;you can go in now. He
seems in a precious humor to-night,&rdquo; added he, in a low whisper;
&ldquo;something or other has gone wrong with him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Driscoll had scarcely closed the inner door of cloth that formed the last
security of Davenport Dunn's privacy, when he perceived the correctness of
Mr. Clowes's information. Dunn's brow was dark and clouded, his face
slightly flushed, and his eye restless and excited.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What is it so very pressing, Driscoll, that could n't wait till
to-morrow?&rdquo; said he, peevishly, and not paying the slightest attention to
the other's courteous salutation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I thought this was the time you liked best,&rdquo; said Driscoll, quietly; &ldquo;you
always said, 'Come to me when I've done for the day&mdash;'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But who told you I had done for the day? That pile of letters has yet to
be answered; many of them I have not even read. The Attorney-General will
be here in a few minutes about these prosecutions too.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's a piece of good luck, anyhow,&rdquo; said Driscoll, quickly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How so? What d' ye mean?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, we could just get a kind of travelling opinion out of him about this
case.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What nonsense you talk!&rdquo; said Dunn, angrily; &ldquo;as if a lawyer of standing
and ability would commit himself by pronouncing on a most complicated
question, the details of which he was to gather from <i>you!</i>&rdquo; The look
and emphasis that accompanied the last word were to the last degree
insulting, but they seemed to give no offence whatever to him to whom they
were addressed; on the contrary, he met them with a twinkle of the eye,
and a droll twist of the mouth, as he muttered half to himself,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, God help me, I 'll never set the Liffey on fire!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You might, though, if you had it heavily insured,&rdquo; said Dunn, with a
savage irony in his manner that might well have provoked rejoinder; but
Driscoll was proof against whatever he didn't want to resent, and laughed
pleasantly at the sarcasm.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You were dining at the Lodge, I suppose, to-day?&rdquo; asked he, eager to get
the conversation afloat at any cost.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, at Luscombe's,&mdash;the Chief Secretary's,&rdquo; said Dunn, curtly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They say he's a clever fellow,&rdquo; said Driscoll.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They are heartily welcome to this opinion who think so,&rdquo; broke in Dunn,
peevishly. &ldquo;Let them call him a fortunate one if they like, and they 'll
be nearer the mark.&mdash;What of this affair?&rdquo; said he, at last &ldquo;Have you
found out Conway?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; but I learned that he dined and passed the evening with ould Paul
Kellett He came over to Ireland to bring him some news of his son, who
served in the same regiment, and so I went out to Kellett to pump them;
but for some reason or other they're as close as wax. The daughter beats
all ever you saw! She tried a great stroke of cunning with me, but it
wouldn't do.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was your poor head and the spotted fever,&mdash;eh?&rdquo; said Dunn,
laughing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Driscoll; &ldquo;I never was rightly myself since that&rdquo; And he
laughed heartily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;This is too slow for me, Driscoll; you must find out the young fellow at
once, and let me see him. I have read over the statement again, and it is
wonderfully complete. Hatch-ard has it now before him, and will give me
his opinion by Sunday next On that same day Mr. Beecher is to dine with
me; now if you could manage to have Conway here on Monday morning, I 'd
probably be in a condition to treat openly with him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You're going too fast,&mdash;too fast, entirely,&rdquo; said Driscoll; &ldquo;sure,
if Conway sees the road before him, he may Just thravel it without us at
all.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'll take care he shall not know which path to take, Driscoll; trust me
for that. Remember that the documents we have are all-essential to him.
Before he sees one of them our terms must be agreed on.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'll have ten thousand paid down on the nail. 'Tis eight years I am
collectin' them papers. I bought that shooting-lodge at Banthry, that
belonged to the Beechers, just to search the old cupboard in the
dinner-room. It was plastered over for fifty years, and Denis Magrath was
the only man living knew where it was.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am aware of all that. The discovery&mdash;if such it prove&mdash;was
all your own, Driscoll; and as to the money remuneration, I 'll not
defraud you of a sixpence.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There was twelve hundred pounds,&rdquo; continued Driscoll, too full of his own
train of thought to think of anything else, &ldquo;for a wretched ould place
with the roof fallin' in, and every stack of it rotten! Eight years last
Michaelmas,&mdash;that's money, let me tell you! and I never got more than
thirty pounds any year out of it since.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You shall be paid, and handsomely paid.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Terry, nodding.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You can have good terms on either side.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, or a little from both,&rdquo; added Driscoll, dryly.

<h2>
CHAPTER XX. AN EVENING WITH GROG DAVIS.
</h2>
<p>
It was late at night, and Grog Davis sat alone by a solitary candle in his
dreary room. The fire had long burned out, and great pools of wet, driven
by the beating rain through the rickety sashes, soaked the ragged carpet
that covered the floor, while frequent gusts of storm scattered the
slates, and shook the foundations of the frail building.
</p>
<p>
To all seeming, he paid little attention to the poor and comfortless
features of the spot. A short square bottle of Hollands, and a paper of
coarse cigars beside him, seemed to offer sufficient defence against such
cares, while he gave up his mind to some intricate problem which he was
working out with a pack of cards. He dealt, and shuffled, and dealt again,
with marvellous rapidity. There was that in each motion of the wrist, in
every movement of the finger, that bespoke practised manipulation, and a
glance quick as lightning on the board was enough to show him how the game
fared.
</p>
<p>
<a name="linkimage-0009" id="linkimage-0009">
<!-- IMG --></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
<img src="images/10230.jpg" width="100%" alt="230 " />
</div>
<p>
&ldquo;Passed twelve times,&rdquo; muttered he to himself; then added aloud, &ldquo;Make
your game, gentlemen, make your game. The game is made. Red, thirty-two.
Now for it, Grog,&mdash;man or a mouse, my boy. Mouse it is! by&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo;
 cried he, with an infamous oath. &ldquo;Red wins! Confound the cards!&rdquo; cried he,
dashing them on the floor. &ldquo;Two minutes ago I had enough to live on the
rest of my days. I appeal to any man in the room,&rdquo; said he, with a look of
peculiar defiance around him, &ldquo;if he ever saw such ill luck! There's not
another fellow breathing ever got it like me!&rdquo; And as he spoke, he arose
and walked up and down the chamber, frowning savagely, and turning glances
of insolent meaning on every side of him. At last, approaching the table,
he filled out a glass of gin and drank it off; and then, stooping down, he
gathered up the cards and reseated himself. &ldquo;Take you fifty on the first
ace,&rdquo; cried he, addressing an imaginary bettor, while he began to deal out
the cards in two separate heaps. &ldquo;Won!&rdquo; exclaimed he, delightedly. &ldquo;Go you
double or quits, sir?&mdash;Any gentleman with another fifty?&mdash;A pony
if you like, sir?&mdash;Done! Won again, by jingo! This is the only game,
after all; decided in a second. I make the bank, gentlemen, two hundred in
the bank. Why, where are the bettors this evening? This is only punting,
gentlemen. Any one say five hundred&mdash;four&mdash;three&mdash;one
hundred&mdash;for the first knave?&rdquo; And the cards fell from his hands with
wondrous rapidity. &ldquo;Now, if no one is inclined to play, let 's have a
broiled bone,&rdquo; said he, rising, and bowing courteously around him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Second the motion!&rdquo; cried a cheery voice, as the door opened and Annesley
Beecher entered. &ldquo;Why, Grog, my hearty, I thought you had a regular flock
of pigeons here. I heard you talking as I came up the stairs, and fancied
you were doing a smart stroke of work.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What robbery have <i>you</i> been at with that white choker and that
gimcrack waistcoat?&rdquo; said Davis, sulkily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Dining with Dunn, and a capital dinner he gave me. I 'm puzzled to say
whether I like his wine or his cookery best.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Were there many there?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;None but ourselves.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Lord! how he must have worked you!&rdquo; cried Davis, with an insolent grin.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ain't such a flat as you think me, Master Grog. Solomon was a wise man,
and Samson a strong one, and A. B. can hold his own with most 'in the
ruck.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A most contemptuous look was the only answer Davis condescended to this
speech. At last, after he had lighted a fresh cigar, and puffed it into
full work, he said, &ldquo;Well, what was it he had to say to you?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, we talked away of everything; and, by Jupiter! he knows a little of
everything. Such a memory, too; remembers every fellow that was in power
the last fifty years, and can tell you how he was 'squared,' for it 's all
on the 'cross' with <i>them</i>, Grog, just as in the ring. Every fellow
rides to order, and half the running one sees is no race! Any hot water to
be had?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, there's cold in that jug yonder. Well, go on with Dunn.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He is very agreeable, I must say; for, besides having met everybody, he
knows all their secret history,&mdash;how this one got out of his scrape,
and why that went into the hole. You see in a moment how much he must be
trusted, and that he can make his book on life as safe as the Bank of
England. Fearfully strong that gin is!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, it ain't,&rdquo; said Grog, rudely; &ldquo;it's not the velvety tipple Dunn gave
you, but it's good British gin, that's what it is.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You would n't believe, too, how much he knows about women! He's up to
everything that's going on in town. Very strange that, for a fellow like
him! Don't you think so?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Davis made no answer, but puffed away slowly. &ldquo;And after women, what came
next?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He talked next&mdash;let me see&mdash;about books. How he likes Becky
Sharp,&mdash;how he enjoys her! He says that character will do the same
service as the published discovery of some popular fraud; and that the
whole race of Beckys now are detected swindlers,&mdash;nothing less.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what if they are? Is that going to prevent their cheating? Hasn't the
world always its crop of flats coming out in succession like green peas?
What did he turn to after that?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then we had a little about the turf.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He don't know anything about the turf!&rdquo; said Grog, with intense contempt.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'm not so sure of that,&rdquo; said Beecher, cautiously.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Did he speak of <i>me</i> at all?&rdquo; said Grog, with a peculiar grin.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; only to ask if you were the same Captain Davis that was mentioned in
that affair at Brighton.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what did you say?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Said! Not knowing, could n't tell, Master Grog. Knew you were a great
friend of my brother Lackington's, and always hand and glove with
Blanchard and the swells.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And how did he take that?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Said something about two of the same name, and changed the subject.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Davis drew near the table, and taking up the cards began to shuffle them
slowly, like one seeking some excuse for a moment of uninterrupted
reflection. &ldquo;I've found out the way that Yankee fellow does the king,&rdquo;
 said he, at last. &ldquo;It's not the common bridge that everybody knows. It's a
Mississippi touch, and a very neat one. Cut them now wherever you like.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Beecher cut the cards with all due care, and leaned eagerly over the
table.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;King of diamonds!&rdquo; cried Grog, slapping the card on the board.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do it again,&rdquo; said Beecher, admiringly; and once more Davis performed the
dexterous feat.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's a nick!&rdquo; cried Beecher, examining the edge of the card minutely.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It ain't no such thing!&rdquo; said Davis, angrily. &ldquo;I'd give you ten years to
find it out, and twenty to do it, and-you 'd fail in both.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let's see the dodge, Grog,&rdquo; said Beecher, half-coaxingly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You don't see <i>my</i> hand till you put <i>yours</i> on the table,&rdquo;
 said Davis, fiercely. Then crossing his arms before him, and fixing his
red fiery eyes on Beecher's face, he went on, &ldquo;What do you mean by this
fencing&mdash;just tell me what you mean by it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don't understand you,&rdquo; said Beecher, whose features were now of ashy
paleness.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then you shall understand me!&rdquo; cried Davis, with an oath. &ldquo;Do you want me
to believe that Dunn had you to dine with him all alone, just to talk
about politics, of which you know nothing, or books, of which you know
less; that he 'd give you four precious hours of a Sunday evening to bear
your opinions about men or women or things in general? Do you ask me to
swallow that, sir?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I ask you to swallow nothing,&rdquo; stammered out Beecher, in whose heart
pride and fear were struggling for the mastery. &ldquo;I have told you what we
spoke of. If anything else passed between us, perhaps it was of a private
and personal nature; perhaps it referred to family topics; perhaps I might
have given a solemn assurance not to reveal the subject of it to any one.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You did,&mdash;did you?&rdquo; said Davis, with a sneer.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I said, perhaps I might have done so. I did n't say I had.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And so you think&mdash;you fancy&mdash;that you 're a going to double on
me,&rdquo; said Davis, rising, and advancing towards him with a sort of
insulting menace. &ldquo;Now, look here, my name ain't Davis but if ever you try
it&mdash;try it, I say, because, as to doing it, I dare you to your face&mdash;but
if you just try it, twelve hours won't pass over till the dock of a police
court is graced by the Honorable Annesley Beecher on a charge of forgery.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Davis!&rdquo; cried Beecher, as he placed his hands over the other's lips,
and glanced in terror through the room. &ldquo;There never was anything I did
n't tell you,&mdash;you 're the only man breathing that knows me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And I do know you, by Heaven, I do!&rdquo; cried the other, savagely; &ldquo;and I
know you'd sneak out of my hands to-morrow, if you dared; but this I tell
you, when you leave <i>mine</i> it will be to exchange into the turnkey's.
You fancy that because I see you are a fool that I don't suspect you to be
a crafty one. Ah! what a mistake you make there!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But listen to me, Grog,&mdash;just hear me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My name 's Davis, sir,&mdash;Captain Davis,&mdash;let me hear you call me
anything else!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, Davis, old fellow,&mdash;the best and truest friend ever fellow had
in the world,&mdash;now what's all this about? I 'll tell you every
syllable that passed between Dunn and myself. I'll give you my oath, as
solemnly as you can dictate it to me, not to conceal one word. He made me
swear never to mention it. It was <i>he</i> that imposed the condition on
me. What he said was this: 'It's a case where you need no counsel, and
where any counsel would be dangerous. He who once knows your secret will
be in a position to dictate to you. Lord Lackington must be your only
adviser, since his peril is the same as your own.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Davis, sternly, as the other seemed to pause too long.
</p>
<p>
Beecher drew a long breath, and, in a voice faint and broken, continued:
&ldquo;It's a claimant to the title,&mdash;a fellow who pretends he derives from
the elder branch,&mdash;the Conway Beechers. All stuff and nonsense,&mdash;they
were extinct two hundred years ago,&mdash;but no matter, the claim is
there, and so circumstantially got up, and so backed by documents and the
rest of it, that Lackington is frightened,&mdash;frightened out of his
wits. The mere exposure, the very rumor of the thing, would distract <i>him</i>.
He's proud as Lucifer,&mdash;and then he's hard up; besides, he wants a
loan, and Dunn tells him there's no getting it till this affair is
disposed of, and that he has hit on the way to do it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;As how?&rdquo; said Davis, dryly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; resumed Beecher, whose utterance grew weaker and less audible at
every word, &ldquo;Lackington, you know, has no children. It 's very unlikely he
ever will now; and Dunn's advice is that for a life interest in the title
and estates I should bind myself not to marry. That fellow then, if he can
make good his claim, comes in as next of kin after <i>me</i>; and as to
who or what comes after <i>me</i>,&rdquo; cried he, with more energy, &ldquo;it
matters devilish little. Once 'toes up' and Annesley Beecher won't fret
over the next match that comes off,&mdash;eh, Grog, old fellow?&rdquo; And he
endeavored by a forced jocularity to encourage his own sinking heart.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here's a shindy!&rdquo; said Grog, as he mixed himself a fresh tumbler and laid
his arms crosswise on the table; &ldquo;and so it's no less than the whole
stakes is on this match?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Title and all,&rdquo; chimed in Beecher.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was n't thinking of the title,&rdquo; said Grog, gruffly, as he relapsed into
a moody silence. &ldquo;Now, what does my Lord say to it all?&rdquo; asked he, after a
long pause.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Lackington?&mdash;Lackington says nothing, or next to nothing. You read
the passage in his letter where he says, 'Call on Dunn,' or 'Speak to
Dunn,' or something like that,&mdash;he did n't even explain about what;
and then you may remember the foolish figure we cut on that morning we
waited on Dunn ourselves, not being able to say why or how we were there.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I remember nothing about cutting a foolish figure anywhere or any time.
It's not very much <i>my</i> habit. It ain't <i>my</i> way of business.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I can't say as much,&rdquo; said Beecher, laughing; &ldquo;and I own frankly I
never felt less at ease in my life.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's <i>your</i> way of business,&rdquo; said Grog, nodding gravely at him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Every fellow is n't born as sharp as you, Davis. Samson was a wise man&mdash;no,
Solomon was a wise man&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Leave Samson and Solomon where they are,&rdquo; said Grog, puffing his cigar.
&ldquo;What we have to look to here is whether there be a claim at all, and then
what it's worth. The whole affair may be just a cross between this fellow
Dunn and one of his own pals. Now, it's my Lord's business to see to that.
<i>You</i> are only the <i>second</i> horse all this while. If my Lord
knows that he can be disqualified, he's wide awake enough to square the
match, he is. But it maybe that Dunn hasn't put the thing fairly before
him. Well, then, you must compare your book with my Lord's. You'll have to
go over to him, Beecher.&rdquo; And the last words were uttered with a solemnity
that showed they were the result of a deep deliberation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's all very well, Master Davis, to talk of going over to Italy; but
where's the tin to come from?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It must be had somehow,&rdquo; said Davis, sententiously. &ldquo;Ain't there any
fellows about would give you a name to a bit of stiff, at thirty-one days'
date?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pumped them all dry long ago!&rdquo; said Beecher, laughing. &ldquo;There's not a man
in the garrison would join me to spoil a stamp; and, as to the civilians,
I scarcely know one who isn't a creditor already.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are always talking to me of a fellow called Kellett,&mdash;why not
have a shy at <i>him?</i>&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Poor Paul!&rdquo; cried Beecher, with a hearty laugh. &ldquo;Why, Paul Kellett's
ruined&mdash;cleaned out&mdash;sold in the Encumbered what d'ye-call-'ems,
and has n't a cross in the world!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I ought to have guessed as much,&rdquo; growled out Grog, &ldquo;or he'd not have
been on such friendly terms with <i>you</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A polite speech that, Grog,&rdquo; said Beecher, smiling.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's true, and that's better,&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;The only fellows that stick
close to a man in his poverty are those a little poorer than himself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not but, if he had it,&rdquo; said Beecher, following up his own thoughts,&mdash;&ldquo;not
but, if he had it, he's just the fellow to do a right good-natured thing.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I suppose he's got his name,&mdash;they have n't sold <i>that</i>,
have they?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, but it's very much like the estate,&rdquo; said Beecher. &ldquo;It's far too
heavily charged ever to pay off the encumbrances.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who minds that, nowadays? A bad bill is a very useful thing sometimes.
It's like a gun warranted to burst, and you can always manage to have it
in the right man's hands when it comes the time for the explosion.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You <i>are</i> a rum un, Davis,&mdash;you <i>are</i>, indeed,&rdquo; said
Beecher, admiringly; for it was in the delivery of such wise maxims that
Davis appeared to him truly great.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Get him down for fifty,&mdash;that ain't much,&mdash;fifty at three
months. My Lord says he 'll stand fifty himself, in that letter I read. It
was to help you to a match, to be sure; but that don't matter. There can
be no question of marrying now. Let me see how this affair is going to
turn. Well, I'll see if I can't do something myself. I've a precious lot
of stamped paper there,&rdquo;&mdash;and he pointed to an old secretary,&mdash;&ldquo;if
I could hit upon a sharp fellow to work it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are a trump, Grog!&rdquo; cried Beecher, delightedly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If we had a clear two hundred, we could start to-morrow,&rdquo; said Grog,
laying down his cigar, and staring steadfastly at him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, would <i>you</i> come, too?&rdquo; muttered Beecher, who had never so much
as imagined the possibility of this companionship on the Continent.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I expect I would,&rdquo; said Davis, with a very peculiar grin. &ldquo;It ain't
likely you'd manage an affair like this without advice.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very true,&mdash;very true,&rdquo; said Beecher, hurriedly. &ldquo;But remember,
Lackington is my brother,&mdash;we 're both in the same boat.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But not with the same skulls,&rdquo; said Grog. And he grinned a savage grin at
the success of his pun.
</p>
<p>
Beecher, however, so far from appreciating the wit, only understood the
remark as a sneer at his intelligence, and half sulkily said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh! I'm quite accustomed to that, now,&mdash;I don't mind it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's right,&mdash;keep your temper,&rdquo; said Grog, calmly; &ldquo;that's the
best thing in <i>your</i> book. You 're what they call good-tempered.
And,&rdquo; added he, in the moralizing tone, &ldquo;though the world does take
liberties with the good-tempered fellows, it shies them many a stray
favor,&mdash;many a sly five-pun'-note into the bargain. I've known
fellows go through life&mdash;and make a rare good thing of it, too&mdash;with
no other stock-in-trade than this same good temper.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Beecher did not pay his habitual attention to Grog's words, but sat
pondering over all the possible and impossible objections to a tour in
such company. There were times and places where men might be seen talking
to such a man as Davis. The betting-ring and the weighing-stand have their
privileges, just like the green-room or the &ldquo;flats,&rdquo; but in neither case
are the intimacies of such localities exactly of a kind for parade before
the world. Of all the perils of such a course none knew better than
Beecher. What society would think,&mdash;what clubs would say of it,&mdash;he
could picture to his mind at once.
</p>
<p>
Now, there were very few of life's casualties of which the Honorable
Annesley Beecher had not tasted. He knew what it was to have his bills
protested, his chattels seized, his person arrested; he had been
browbeaten by Bankruptcy Commissioners, and bullied by sheriffs' officers;
tradesmen had refused him credit; tailors abjured his custom; he had
&ldquo;burned his fingers&rdquo; in one or two not very creditable transactions; but
still, with all this, there was yet one depth to which he had not
descended,&mdash;he was never seen in public with a &ldquo;wrong man.&rdquo; He had a
jerk of the head, a wink, or a glance for the leg who met him in
Piccadilly, as every one else had. If he saw him in the garden of the Star
and Garter, or the park at Greenwich, he might even condescend to banter
him on &ldquo;looking jolly,&rdquo; and ask what new &ldquo;robbery&rdquo; he was in for; but as
to descending to intimacy or companionship openly before the gaze of the
world, he 'd as soon have thought of playing cad to a 'bus, or sweep at a
crossing.
</p>
<p>
It was true the Continent was not Hyde Park,&mdash;the most strait-laced
and well-conducted did fifty things there they had never ventured on at
home. Foreign travel had its license, and a passport was a sort of plenary
indulgence for many a social transgression; but, with all this, there were
a few names&mdash;about half a dozen in all Europe&mdash;that no man could
afford to link his own along with.
</p>
<p>
As for Grog, he was known everywhere. From Ostend to Odessa his fame
extended, and there was scarcely a police prefect in the travelled
districts of the Continent that had not a description of his person, and
some secret instructions respecting him. From many of the smaller states,
whose vigilance is in the ratio of their littleness, he was rigidly
excluded; so that in his journeying through Europe, he was often reduced
to a zigzag and erratic procedure, not unlike the game known to schoolboys
as scotch-hop. In the ten minutes&mdash;it was not more&mdash;that Beecher
passed in recalling these and like facts to his memory, his mind grew more
and more perplexed; nor was the embarrassment unperceived by him who
caused it. As Davis sipped and smoked, he stole frequent glances at his
companion's face, and strove to read what was passing in his mind. &ldquo;It may
be,&rdquo; thought Grog, &ldquo;he does n't see his way to raising the money. It may
be that his credit is lower in the market than I fancied; or&rdquo;&mdash;and
now his fiery eyes grew fiercer and his lip more tense&mdash;&ldquo;or it may be
that he doesn't fancy <i>my</i> company. If I was only sure it was <i>that</i>,&rdquo;
 muttered he between his teeth; and had Annesley Beecher only chanced to
look at him as he said it, the expression of that face would have left a
legacy of fear behind it for many a day.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Help yourself,&rdquo; said Grog, passing the bottle across the table,&mdash;&ldquo;help
yourself, and the gin will help you, for I see you are 'pounded.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pounded? No, not a bit; nothing of the kind,&rdquo; said Beecher, blushing. &ldquo;I
was thinking how Lackington would take all this; what my Lady would say to
it; whether they 'd regard it seriously, or whether they 'd laugh at my
coming out so far about nothing.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They'll not laugh, depend on't; take my word for it, they won't laugh,&rdquo;
 said Davis, dryly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, but if it all comes to nothing,&mdash;if it be only a plant to
extort money?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Even that ain't anything to laugh at,&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;I 've done a little
that way myself, and yet I never saw the fellow who was amused by it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So that you really think I ought to go out and see my brother?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm sure and certain that we must go,&rdquo; said Davis, just giving the very
faintest emphasis to the &ldquo;we.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But it will cost a pot of money, Grog, even though I should travel in the
cheapest way,&mdash;I mean, the cheapest way possible for a fellow as well
known as I am.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This was a bold stroke; it was meant to imply far more than the mere words
announced. It was intended to express a very complicated argument in a
mere innuendo.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's all gammon,&rdquo; said Grog, rudely. &ldquo;We don't live in an age of
couriers and extra-post; every man travels by rail nowadays, and nobody
cares whether you take a coupé or a horse-box; and as to being known, so
am I, and almost as well known as most fellows going.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This was pretty plain speaking; and Beecher well knew that Davis's
frankness was always on the verge of the only one thing that was worse
than frankness.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said Beecher, after a pause, &ldquo;let the journey be ever so
necessary, I have n't got the money.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I know you haven't, neither have I; but we shall get it somehow. You 'll
have to try Kellett; you 'll have to try Dunn himself, perhaps. I don't
see why you should n't start with him. <i>He</i> knows that you ought to
confer with my Lord; and he could scarce refuse your note at three months,
if you made it&mdash;say fifty.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But, Grog,&rdquo; said Beecher, laying down his cigar, and nerving himself for
a great effort of cool courage, &ldquo;what would suffice fairly enough for one,
would be a very sorry allowance for two; and as the whole of my business
will be with my own brother,&mdash;where of necessity I must be alone with
him,&mdash;don't you agree with me that a third person would only
embarrass matters rather than advance them?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Grog, sternly, while he puffed his cigar in measured time.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'm speaking,&rdquo; said Beecher, in a tone of apology,&mdash;&ldquo;I'm speaking,
remember, from my knowledge of Lackington. He's very high and very proud,&mdash;one
of those fellows who 'take on,' even with their equals; and with myself,
he never forgets to let me feel I'm a younger brother.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He would n't take any airs with <i>me</i>,&rdquo; said Grog, insolently. And
Beecher grew actually sick at the bare thought of such a meeting.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I tell you frankly, Davis,&rdquo; said he, with the daring of despair, &ldquo;it
wouldn't do. It would spoil all. First and foremost, Lackington would
never forgive me for having confided this secret to any one. He'd say, and
not unfairly either, 'What has Davis to do with this? It's not the kind of
case he is accustomed to deal with; his counsel could n't possibly be
essential here.' <i>He</i> does n't know,&rdquo; added he, rapidly, &ldquo;your
consummate knowledge of the world; <i>he</i> hasn't seen, as I have, how
keenly you read every fellow that comes before you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We start on Monday,&rdquo; said Grog, abruptly, as he threw the end of his
cigar into the fire; &ldquo;so stir yourself, and see about the bills.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Beecher arose and walked the room with hurried strides, his brow growing
darker and his face more menacing at every moment.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Look here, Davis,&rdquo; cried he, turning suddenly round and facing the other,
&ldquo;you assume to treat me as if I was a&mdash;schoolboy;&rdquo; and it was evident
that he had intended a stronger word, but had not courage to utter it, for
Davis's wicked eyes were upon him, and a bitter grin of irony was already
on Grog's mouth as he said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Did you ever try a round with <i>me</i> without getting the worst of it?
Do you remember any time where you came well out of it? You 've been
mauled once or twice somewhat roughly, but with the gloves on,&mdash;always
with the gloves on. Now, take my advice, and don't drive me to take them
off,&mdash;don't! You never felt my knuckles yet,&mdash;and, by the Lord
Harry, if you had, you'd not call out 'Encore.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You just want to bully me,&rdquo; said Beecher, in a whimpering tone.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bully you,&mdash;bully <i>you!</i>&rdquo; said Davis, and his features put on a
look of the most intense scorn as he spoke. &ldquo;Egad!&rdquo; cried he, with an
insolent laugh, &ldquo;you know very little about either of us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'd rather you'd do your worst at once than keep threatening me in this
fashion.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, you would n't; no&mdash;no&mdash;nothing of the kind,&rdquo; said Davis,
with a mockery of gentleness in his voice and manner.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;May I be hanged if I would not!&rdquo; cried Beecher, passionately.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It ain't hanging now,&mdash;they 've made it transportation,&rdquo; said Davis,
with a grin; &ldquo;and them as has tried it says the old way was easiest.&rdquo; And
in the slang style of the last words there was a terrible significance,&mdash;it
was as though a voice from the felons' dock was uttering a word of
warning. Such was the effect on Beecher that he sank slowly down into a
seat, silent and powerless.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If you had n't been in this uncommon high style tonight,&rdquo; said Grog,
quietly, &ldquo;I'd have told you some excellent reasons for what I was
advising. I got a letter from Spicer this morning. He, and a foreign
fellow he calls Count Lienstahl,&mdash;it sounds devilish like 'lie and
steal,' don't it?&mdash;have got a very pretty plant together, and if they
could only chance upon a good second-rate horse, they reckon about eight
or ten hundred in stakes alone this coming spring. They offer me a share
if I could come out to them, and mean to open the campaign at Brussels.
Now, there's a thing to suit us all,&mdash;'picking for every one,' as
they say in the oakum-sheds.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Cochin China might be had for five hundred; or there's Spotted Snake,
they want to sell him for anything he'll bring,&rdquo; said Beecher, with
animation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They could manage five hundred at least, Spicer says. We 're good for
about twelve thousand francs, which ought to get us what we're looking
for.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There's Anchovy Paste&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Broke down before and behind.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Hop the Twig, own sister to Levanter; ran second for the Colchester Cup&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mares don't answer abroad.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, what do you say to Mumps?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There's the horse for the Continent. A great heavy-headed, thick-jawed
beast, with lazy action, and capped hocks. He's the animal to walk into a
foreign jockey club. Oh, if we had him!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I know where he is!&rdquo; exclaimed Beecher, in ecstasy. &ldquo;There 's a Brummagem
fellow driving him through Wales,&mdash;a bagman,&mdash;and he takes him a
turn now and then for the county stakes that offer. I 'll lay my head on't
we get him for fifty pounds.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come, old fellow,&rdquo; said Grog, encouragingly, &ldquo;you <i>have</i> your wits
about you, after all. Breakfast here to-morrow, about twelve o'clock, and
we 'll see if we can't arrange the whole affair. It's a sure five hundred
apiece, as if we had it here;&rdquo; and he slapped his pockets as he spoke.
</p>
<p>
Beecher shook his friend's hand with a warmth that showed all his wonted
cordiality, and with a hearty &ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo; they separated.
</p>
<p>
Grog had managed cleverly. He had done something by terror, and the rest
he had accomplished by temptation. They were the two only impulses to sway
that strange temperament.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXI. A DARK DAY
</h2>
<p>
It was the day appointed for the sale of Kellett's Court, and a
considerable crowd was assembled to witness the proceeding. Property was
rapidly changing hands; new names were springing up in every county, and
old ones were growing obsolete. Had the tide of conquest and confiscation
flowed over the land, a greater social revolution could not have resulted;
and while many were full of hope and confidence that a new prosperity was
about to dawn upon Ireland, there were some who continued to deplore the
extinction of the old names, and the exile of the old families, whose
traditions were part of the history of the country.
</p>
<p>
Kellett's Court was one of those great mansions which the Irish gentlemen
of a past age were so given to building, totally forgetting how great the
disproportion was between their house and their rent-roll. Irregular,
incongruous, and inelegant, it yet, by its very size and extent, possessed
a certain air of grandeur. Eighty guests had sat down to table in that oak
wainscoted dinner-room; above a hundred had been accommodated with beds
beneath that roof; the stables had stalls for every hunting-man that came;
and the servants' hall was a great galleried chamber, like the refectory
of a convent, in everything save the moderation of the fare.
</p>
<p>
Many were curious to know who would purchase an estate burdened by so
costly a residence, the very maintenance of which in repair constituted a
heavy annual outlay. The gardens, long neglected and forgotten, occupied
three acres, and were themselves a source of immense expense; a
considerable portion of the demesne was so purely ornamental that it
yielded little or no profit; and, as an evidence of the tastes and habits
of its former owners, the ruins of a stand-house marked out where races
once were held in the park, while hurdle fences and deep drains even yet
disfigured the swelling lawn.
</p>
<p>
Who was to buy such a property was the question none could answer. The
house, indeed, might be converted into a &ldquo;Union,&rdquo; if its locality suited;
it was strong enough for a jail, it was roomy enough for a nunnery. Some
averred the Government had decided on purchasing it for a barrack; others
pretended that the sisterhood of the Sacred Heart had already made their
bargain for it; yet to these and many other assertions not less
confidently uttered there were as many demurrers.
</p>
<p>
While rumors and contradictions were still buzzed about, the Commissioner
took his place on the bench, and the clerk of the Court began that tedious
recital of the circumstances of the estate with whose details all the
interested were already familiar, and the mere curious cared not to listen
to. An informality on a former day had interfered with the sale, a fact
which the Commissioner alluded to with satisfaction, as property had risen
largely in value in the interval, and he now hoped that the estate would
not alone clear off all the charges against it, but realize something for
its former owner. A confused murmur of conversation followed this
announcement. Men talked in knots and groups, consulted maps and
rent-rolls, made hasty calculations in pencil, whispered secretly
together, muttering frequently the words &ldquo;Griffith,&rdquo; &ldquo;plantation measure,&rdquo;
 &ldquo;drainage,&rdquo; and &ldquo;copyhold,&rdquo; and then, in a half-hurried, half-wearied way,
the Court asked, &ldquo;Is there no bidding after twenty-seven thousand five
hundred?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Twenty-eight!&rdquo; said a deep voice near the door.
</p>
<p>
A long, dreary pause followed, and the sale was over.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Twenty-eight thousand!&rdquo; cried Lord Glengariff; &ldquo;the house alone cost
fifty.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's only the demesne, my Lord,&rdquo; said some one near; &ldquo;it's not the estate
is sold.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I know it, sir; but the demesne contains eight hundred acres, fully
wooded, and enclosed by a wall.&mdash;Who is it for, Dunn?&rdquo; asked he,
turning to that gentleman.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;In trust, my Lord,&rdquo; was the reply.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of that I am aware, sir; you have said as much to the Court.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Dunn bent over, and whispered some words in his ear.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed the other, with evident astonishment; &ldquo;and intending
to reside?&rdquo; added he.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Eventually, I expect so,&rdquo; said Dunn, cautiously, as others were now
attending to the conversation.
</p>
<p>
Again Lord Glengariff spoke; but, ere he had finished, a strange movement
of confusion in the body of the Court interrupted him, while a voice
hoarse with passionate meaning cried out, &ldquo;Is the robbery over?&mdash;is
it done?&rdquo; and a large, powerful man, his face flushed, and his eyes
glaring wildly, advanced through the crowd to the railing beneath the
bench. His waistcoat was open, and he held his cravat in one hand, having
torn it off in the violence of his excitement.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who is this man?&rdquo; asked the Commissioner, sternly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'll tell you who I am,&mdash;Paul Kellett, of Kellett's Court, the owner
of that house and estate you and your rascally miscreants have just stolen
from me,&mdash;ay, stolen is the word; law or justice have nothing to do
with it. Your Parliament made it law, to be sure, to pamper your
Manchester upstarts who want to turn gentlemen&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Does any one know him?&mdash;has he no friends who will look after him?&rdquo;
 said the Commissioner, leaning over and addressing those beneath in a
subdued voice.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Devil a friend in the world! It's few friends stick to the man whose
property comes here. But don't make me out mad. I 'm in my full senses,
though I had enough to turn fifty men to madness.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I know him, my Lord; with the permission of the Court, I 'll take charge
of him,&rdquo; said Dunn, in a tone so low as to be audible only to a few.
Kellett, however, was one of them, and he immediately cried out,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Take charge of me! Ay, that he will. He took charge of my estate, too,
and he 'll do by <i>me</i> what he did with the property,&mdash;give a
bargain of me!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A hearty burst of laughter filled the hall at this sally; for Dunn was one
of those men whose prosperity always warrants the indulgence of a sarcasm.
The Court, however, could no longer brook the indecorous interruption, and
sternly ordered that Kellett might be removed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My dear Mr. Kellett, pray remember yourself; only recollect where you
are; such conduct will only expose you&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Expose me! do you think I've any shame left in me? Do you think, when a
man is turned out to starve on the roads, that he cares much what people
say of him?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;This interruption is intolerable,&rdquo; said the Commissioner. &ldquo;If he be not
speedily removed, I 'll order him into the custody of the police.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do, in God's name,&rdquo; cried Kellett, calmly. &ldquo;Anything that will keep me
from laying hands on myself, or somebody else, will be a charity.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come with me, Kellett,&mdash;do come along with <i>me!</i>&rdquo; said Dunn,
entreatingly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not a step,&mdash;not an inch. It was going with <i>you</i> brought me
here. This man, my Lord,&rdquo; cried he, addressing the Court with a wild
earnestness,&mdash;&ldquo;this man said to me that this was the time to sell a
property,&mdash;that land was rising every day; that if we came into the
Court now, it's not twenty, nor twenty-five, but thirty years' purchase&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am sorry, sir,&rdquo; said the Commissioner, sternly, &ldquo;that you will give me
no alternative but that of committing you; such continued disrespect of
Court cannot longer be borne.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'm as well in jail as anywhere else. You 've robbed me of my property,
I care little for my person. I'll never believe it's law,&mdash;never! You
may sit up with your wig and your ushers and your criers, but you are just
a set of thieves and swindlers, neither more nor less. Talk of shame,
indeed! I think some of yourselves might blush at what you 're doing.
There, there, I 'm not going to resist you,&rdquo; said he to the policeman;
&ldquo;there's no need of roughness. Newgate is the best place for me now.
Mind,&rdquo; added he, turning to where the reporters for the daily press were
sitting,&mdash;&ldquo;mind and say that I just offered a calm protest against
the injustice done me; that I was civilly remonstrating with the Court
upon what every man&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Ere he could finish, he was quietly removed from the spot, and before the
excitement of the scene had subsided, he was driving away rapidly towards
Newgate.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Drunk or mad,&mdash;which was it?&rdquo; said Lord Glengariff to Davenport
Dunn, whose manner was scarcely as composed as usual.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He has been drinking, but not to drunkenness,&rdquo; said Dunn, cautiously. &ldquo;He
is certainly to be pitied.&rdquo; And now he drew nigh the bench and whispered a
few words to the Commissioner.
</p>
<p>
Whatever it was that he urged&mdash;and there was an air of entreaty in
his manner&mdash;did not seem to meet the concurrence of the judge. Dunn
pleaded earnestly, however; and at last the Commissioner said, &ldquo;Let him be
brought up tomorrow, then, and having made a suitable apology to the
Court, we will discharge him.&rdquo; Thus ended the incident, and once more the
clerk resumed his monotonous readings. Townlands and baronies were
described, valuations quoted, rights of turbary defined, and an ancient
squirearchy sold out of their possessions with as little commotion or
excitement as a mock Claude is knocked down at Christie's. Indeed, of so
little moment was the scene we have mentioned deemed, that scarcely half a
dozen lines of the morning papers were given to its recital. The Court and
its doings were evidently popular with the country at large, and one of
the paragraphs which readers read with most pleasure was that wherein it
was recorded that estates of immense value had just changed owners, and
that the Commissioner had disposed of so many thousands' worth of landed
property within the week.
</p>
<p>
Sweeping measures, of whatever nature they be, have always been in favor
with the masses; never was any legislation so popular as the guillotine!
</p>
<p>
Evening was closing in, the gloomy ending of a gloomy day in winter, and
Sybella Kellett sat at the window anxiously watching for her father's
return. The last two days had been passed by her in a state of feverish
uneasiness. Since her father's attendance at the custom-house ceased,&mdash;.
for he had been formally dismissed at the beginning of the week,&mdash;his
manner had exhibited strange alternations of wild excitement and deep
depression. At times he would move hurriedly about, talking rapidly,
sometimes singing to himself; at others he would sit in a state of torpor
for hours. He drank, too, affecting some passing pain or some uneasiness
as an excuse for the whiskey-bottle; and when gently remonstrated with on
the evil consequences, became fearfully passionate and excited. &ldquo;I suppose
I 'll be called a drunkard next; there 's nothing more likely than I 'll
be told it was my own sottish habits brought all this ruin upon me. 'He 's
a sot.'&mdash;'He 's never sober.'&mdash;'Ask his own daughter about
him.'&rdquo; And then stimulating himself, he would become furious with rage. As
constantly, too, did he inveigh against Dunn, saying that it was he that
ruined him, and that had he not listened to his treacherous counsels he
might have arranged matters with his creditors. From these bursts of
passion he would fall into moods of deepest melancholy, accusing his own
folly and recklessness as the cause of all his misfortunes, and even
pushing self-condemnation so far as to assert that it was his misconduct
and waste had driven poor Jack from home and made him enlist as a soldier.
</p>
<p>
Bella could not but see that his intellect was affected and his judgment
impaired, and she made innumerable pretexts to be ever near him. Now she
pretended that she required air and exercise, that her spirits were low,
and needed companionship. Then she affected to have little purchases to
make in town, and asked him to bear her company. At length he showed a
restlessness under this restraint that obliged her to relax it; he even
dropped chance words as if he suspected that he was the object of some
unusual care and supervision. &ldquo;There's no need of watching me,&rdquo; said he,
rudely, to her on the morning that preceded the sale; &ldquo;I 'm in no want of
a keeper. They 'll see Paul Kellett 's not the man to quail under any
calamity; the same to-day, to-morrow, and the next day. Sell him out or
buy him in, and you 'll never know by his face that he felt it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He spoke very little on that morning, and scarcely tasted his breakfast.
His dress was more careful than usual; and Bella, half by way of saying
something, asked if he were going into Dublin.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Into Dublin! I suppose I am, indeed,&rdquo; said he, curtly, as though giving a
very obvious reply. &ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; added he, after a few minutes,&mdash;&ldquo;maybe
you forget this is the seventeenth, and that this is the day for the
sale.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I did remember it,&rdquo; said she, with a faint sigh, but not daring to ask
how his presence there was needed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you were going to say,&rdquo; added he, with a bitter smile, &ldquo;what did that
matter to me, and that wasn't wanted. Neither I am,&mdash;I 'm neither
seller nor buyer; but still I 'm the last of the name that lived there,&mdash;I
was Kellett of Kellett's Court, and there 'll never be another to say the
same, and I owe it to myself to be there to-day,&mdash;just as I 'd attend
a funeral,&mdash;just as I 'd follow the hearse.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It will only give you needless pain, dearest father,&rdquo; said she,
soothingly; &ldquo;pray do not go.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faith, I'll go if it gave me a fit,&rdquo; said he, fiercely. &ldquo;They may say
when they go home, 'Paul Kellett was there the whole time, as cool as <i>I</i>
am now; you 'd never believe it was the old family place&mdash;the house
his ancestors lived in for centuries&mdash;was up for sale; there he was,
calm and quiet If that is n't courage, tell me what is.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And yet I 'd rather you did not go, father. The world has trials enough
to tax our energies, that we should not go in search of them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's a woman's way of looking at it,&rdquo; said he, contemptuously.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A man with a man's heart likes to meet danger, just to see how he 'll
treat it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But remember, father&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There, now,&rdquo; said he, rising from the table, &ldquo;if you talked till you were
tired, I 'd go still. My mind is made up on it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Bella turned away her head, and stole her handkerchief to her eyes.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I know very well,&rdquo; burst he in, bitterly, &ldquo;that the blackguard newspapers
to-morrow will just be as ready to abuse me for it. It would have been
more dignified, or more decent, or something or other, if Mr. Kellett had
not appeared at the sale; but I 'll go, nevertheless, if it was only to
see the man that's to take our place there! Wait dinner for me till six,&mdash;that
is, if there 's any dinner at all.&rdquo; And, with a laugh of bitterest
meaning, he left the room, and was soon seen issuing from the little
garden into the road.
</p>
<p>
What a sad day, full of gloomy forebodings, was that for her! She knew
well how all the easy and careless humor of her father had been changed by
calamity into a spirit fierce and resentful; that, suspectful of insult on
every hand, he held himself ever prepared to meet the most harmless remark
with words of defiance. An imaginary impression that the world had agreed
to scorn him, made him adopt a bearing at once aggressive and offensive;
and he who was once a proverb for good temper became irritable and savage
to a degree.
</p>
<p>
What might not come of such a temperament, tried in its tenderest spot?
What might occur to expose him to the heartless sneers of those who
neither knew his qualities nor his trials? These were her thoughts as she
walked to and fro in her little room, unable to read, unable to write,
though she made several attempts to begin a letter to her brother. The
dark future also lowered before, without one flicker of light to pierce
its gloom. How were they to live? In a few days more they would be at the
end of their frail resources,&mdash;something less than two pounds was all
that they had in the world. How she envied those in some foreign land who
could stoop to the most menial labor, unseen and unremembered by their
own. How easily, she thought, poverty might be borne, if divested of the
terrible contrast with a former condition. Could they by any effort raise
the means to emigrate,&mdash;and where to? Might not Mr. Dunn be the
person to give counsel in such a case? From all she had heard of him, he
was conversant with every career, every walk, and every condition.
Doubtless he could name the very colony, and the very spot to suit them,&mdash;nor
impossible that he might aid them to reach it. If they prospered, they
could repay him. They might pledge themselves to such a condition on this
head as he would dictate. How, then, to approach him? A letter? And yet a
letter was always so wanting in the great requisite of answering doubts as
they arose, and meeting difficulties by ready re-Joinder. A personal
interview would do this. Then why not ask for an audience of him? &ldquo;I'll
call upon him at once,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;he may receive me without other
solicitation,&mdash;my name will surely secure me that much of attention.&rdquo;
 Would her father approve of such a step?&mdash;would it not appear to his
eyes an act of meanness and dependence?&mdash;might not the whole scheme
be one to which he would offer opposition? From conflicts like these she
came back to the dreary present and wondered what could still delay his
coming. It was a road but little travelled; and as she sat watching at the
window, her eyes grew wearied piercing the hazy atmosphere, darkening
deeper and deeper as night drew near. She endeavored to occupy herself in
various ways: she made little preparations for his coming; she settled his
room neatly, over and over; she swept the hearth, and made a cheerful fire
to greet him; and then, passing into the kitchen, she looked after the
humble dinner that awaited him. Six o'clock passed, and another weary hour
followed. Seven,&mdash;and still he came not. She endeavored to divert her
thoughts into thinking of the future she had pictured to herself. She
tried to fancy the scenery, the climate, the occupation of that dream-land
over the seas; but at every bough that beat against the window by the
wind, at every sound of the storm without, she would start up, and hasten
to the door to listen.
</p>
<p>
It was now near eight o'clock; and so acute had her hearing become by
intense anxiety that she could detect the sounds of a footfall coming
along the plashy road. She did not venture to move, lest she should lose
the sound, and she dreaded, too, lest it should pass on. She bent down her
head to hear; and now, oh, ecstasy of relief! she heard the latch of the
little wicket raised, and the step upon the gravel-walk within. She rushed
at once to the door, and, dashing out into the darkness, threw herself
wildly upon his breast, saying, &ldquo;Thank God you are come! Oh, how I have
longed for you, dearest, dearest father!&rdquo; And then as suddenly, with a
shriek, cried out, &ldquo;Who is it? Who is this?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Conway,&mdash;Charles Conway. A friend,&mdash;at least, one who would
wish to be thought so.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
With a wild and rapid utterance she told him of her long and weary watch,
and that her fears&mdash;mere causeless fears, she said she knew they were&mdash;had
made her nervous and miserable. Her father's habits, always so regular and
homely, made even an hour's delay a source of anxiety. &ldquo;And then he had
not been well for some days back,&mdash;circumstances had occurred to
agitate him; things preyed upon him more heavily than they had used.
Perhaps it was the dreary season&mdash;perhaps their solitary kind of life&mdash;had
rendered them both more easily depressed. But, somehow&mdash;&rdquo; She could
not go on; but hastening towards the window, pressed her hands to her
face.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If you could tell me where I would be likely to hear of him,&mdash;what
are his haunts in town&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He has none,&mdash;none whatever. He has entirely ceased to visit any of
his former friends; even Mr. Beecher he has not called on for months
long.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Has he business engagements in any quarter that you know of?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;None now. He did hold an office in the Customs, but he does so no longer.
It is possible&mdash;just possible&mdash;he might have called at Mr.
Dunn's, but he could not have been detained there so late as this. And if
he were&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped, confused and embarrassed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;As to that,&rdquo; said he, catching at her difficulty with ready tact, &ldquo;I
could easily pretend it was my own anxiety that caused the visit. I could
tell him it was likely I should soon see Jack again, and ask of him to let
me be the bearer of some kind message to him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; muttered Bella, half vacantly; for he had only given to his
words the meaning of a mere pretext.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I think you may trust to me that I will manage the matter delicately. He
shall never suspect that he has given any uneasiness by his absence.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But even this,&rdquo; said she, eagerly, &ldquo;condemns me to some hours longer of
feverish misery. You cannot possibly go back to town and return here in
less than two&mdash;perhaps three hours.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'll try and do it in half the time,&rdquo; said Conway, rising, and taking
his cap. &ldquo;Where does Mr. Dunn live?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;In Menion Square. I forget the number, but it does not matter; every one
knows his house. It is on the north side.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You shall see me before&mdash;What o'clock is it now?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Half-past eight,&rdquo; said she, shuddering, as she saw how late it was.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Before eleven, I promise you confidently,&mdash;and earlier if I can.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You know my father so very little&mdash;so very recently,&rdquo; said Sybella,
with some confusion, &ldquo;that it may be necessary to guard you,&mdash;that
is, you ought to be made aware that on this day the estate our family has
held for centuries was sold. It is true we are no poorer than we were
yesterday; the property we called our own, and from habit believed to be
such, had been mortgaged this many a year. Why or how we ever fancied that
one day or other we should be in a position to pay off the encumbrances, I
cannot tell you; but it is true that we did so fancy, and used to talk of
that happy event as of one we felt to be in store for us. Well, the blow
has fallen at last, and demolished all our castle-building! Like
storm-tossed vessels, we saw ships sinking on every side, and yet caught
at hope for ourselves. This hope has now left us. The work of this morning
has obliterated every trace of it. It is of this, then, I would ask you to
be mindful when you see my poor father. He has seen ruin coming this many
a year; it never came face to face with him till to-day. I cannot tell how
he may brave it, though there was a time I could have answered for his
courage.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Jack Kellett's father could scarcely be deficient in that quality,&rdquo; said
Conway, whose flashing eyes showed that it was Jack's sister was uppermost
in his mind as he spoke.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said she, sorrowfully, &ldquo;great as the heroism is that meets death on
the field of battle, it is nothing to the patient and enduring bravery
that confronts the daily ills of life,&mdash;confronts them nobly, but in
humility, neither buoyed up by inordinate hope, nor cast down by
despondency, but manfully resolved to do one's best, and, come what may,
to do it without sacrifice of self-respect. Thus meeting fate, and with a
temper that all the crosses of life have not made irritable nor
suspectful, makes a man to my eyes a greater hero than any of those who
charge in forlorn hopes, or single-handed rush up the breach torn by
grape-shot.&rdquo; Her cheek, at first pale, grew deeper and deeper red, and her
dark eyes flashed till their expression became almost wild in brilliancy,
when, suddenly checking her passionate mood, she said, &ldquo;It were better I
should go along with you,&mdash;better, at least, I were at hand. He will
bear much from me that he would not endure from another, and I will go.&rdquo;
 So saying, she hastened from the room, and in a moment came back shawled
and ready for the road.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What a night for you to venture out,&rdquo; said Conway; &ldquo;and I have got no
carriage of any kind.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am well accustomed to brave bad weather, and care nothing for it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is raining fearfully, and the waves are washing clear over the low
sea-wall,&rdquo; said he, trying to dissuade her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have come out here on many such nights, and never the worse for it.
Can't you fancy Jack Kellett's sister equal to more than this?&rdquo; said she,
smiling through all her sadness, as she led the way to the door.
</p>
<p>
And now they were upon the road, the wild rain and the gusty wind beating
against them, and almost driving them back. So loud the storm that they
did not try to speak, but with her arm close locked within his own, Conway
breasted the hurricane with a strange sensation of delight he had never
known before.
</p>
<p>
Scarcely a word passed between them as they went; as the rain beat heavily
against her he would try as well as he could to shelter her; when the
cutting wind blew more severely, he would draw her arm closer within his
own; and yet, thus in silence, they grew to each other like friends of
many a year. A sense of trustfulness, a feeling of a common object too,
sufficed to establish between them a sentiment to be moulded by the events
of after-life into anything. Ay, so is it! Out of these chance affinities
grow sometimes the passion of a life, and sometimes the disappointments
that embitter existence!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What a good fortune it was that brought you to my aid to-night,&rdquo; said
she; &ldquo;I had not dared to have come this long road alone.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What a good fortune mine to have even so humble a service to render you!
Jack used to talk to me of you for hours long. Nights just like this have
we passed together; he telling me about your habits and your ways, so that
this very incident seems to fit into the story of your life as an
every-day occurrence. I know,&rdquo; continued he, as she seemed to listen
attentively, &ldquo;how you used to ride over the mountains at home, visiting
wild and out-of-the-way spots; how you joined him in his long fishing
excursions, exploring the deep mountain gorges while he lingered by the
riverside. The very names you gave these desolate places&mdash;taken from
old books of travel&mdash;showed me how a spirit of enterprise was in your
heart.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Were they not happy days!&rdquo; murmured she, half to herself.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They must have been,&rdquo; said he, ardently; &ldquo;to hear of them has charmed the
weariest watches of the night, and made me long to know you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; but I am not what I was,&rdquo; said she, hastily. &ldquo;Out of that dreamy,
strange existence I have awakened to a world full of its own stern
realities. That pleasant indolence has ill prepared me for the road I must
travel; and it was selfish too! The vulgarest cares of every-day life are
higher aims than all the mere soarings of imagination, and of this truth I
am only now becoming aware.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But it was for never neglecting those very duties Jack used to praise
you; he said that none save himself knew you as other than the careful
mistress of a household.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Poor fellow! ours was an humble retinue, and needed little guidance.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Conway, &ldquo;you are too proud to accept of such esteem as mine;
but yet you can't prevent me offering it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Have I not told you how I prize your kindness?&rdquo; said she, gently.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Will you let me think so?&rdquo; cried Conway, pressing her arm closely; and
again they were silent Who knows with what thoughts?
</p>
<p>
How dreary did the streets seem as they entered Dublin! The hazy lamps,
dulled by the fast-falling rain, threw a misty light through the loaded
atmosphere; the streets, deserted by all but the very poorest were silent
and noiseless, save for the incessant plash of the rain; few lights were
seen on any side, and all was darkness and gloom. Wearily they plodded
onward, Sybella deeply sunk in her own thoughts as to the future, and
Conway, too respectful of her feelings to interrupt her, never uttered a
word as they went. At last they reached Merrion Square, and after some
little search stood at the door of Mr. Davenport Dunn. Sybella drew a
heavy sigh as Conway knocked loudly, and muttered to herself, &ldquo;Heaven
grant me good tidings of my father!&rdquo;

<h2>
CHAPTER XXII. AFTER A DINNER-PARTY
</h2>
<p>
Mr. Davenport Dunn had a dinner-party,&mdash;he entertained the notables
of the capital; and a chief secretary, a couple of judges, a poor-law
commissioner, and some minor deities, soldier and civilian, formed his
company. They were all social, pleasant, and conversational. The country
was growing governable, calendars were light, military duty a mere
pastime, and they chatted agreeably over reminiscences of a time&mdash;not
very remote neither&mdash;when Rockites were rife, jails crammed, and the
fatigues and perils of a soldier not inferior to those of actual warfare.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To our worthy host here!&rdquo; said the Chief Baron, eying his claret before
the light,&mdash;and it was a comet vintage,&mdash;&ldquo;to our worthy host
here are we indebted for most of this happy change.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Under Providence,&rdquo; whispered the oily Dean of the Chapel Royal.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course, so I mean,&rdquo; said the judge, with that kind of impatience he
would have met a needless suggestion in court. &ldquo;Great public works,
stupendous enterprises, and immense expenditure of capital have
encountered rebellion by the best of all methods,&mdash;prosperity!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is it really extinct,&mdash;has Lazarus died, or is he only sleeping?&rdquo;
 interposed a small dark-eyed man, with a certain air of determination and
a look of defiance that seemed to invite discussion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I should, at all events, call it a trance that must lead to perfect
recovery,&rdquo; said the Chief Secretary. &ldquo;Ireland is no longer a difficulty.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She may soon become something more,&rdquo; said the dark man; &ldquo;instead of
embarrassing your counsels, she may go far towards swaying and controlling
them. The energies that were once wasted in factious struggles at home
here, may combine to carry on a greater combat in England; and it might
even happen that your statesmen might look back with envy to days of
orange-and-green memory.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She would gladly welcome the change you speak of.&rdquo; said the Secretary.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm not so sure of that, sir; you have not already shown yourselves so
very tolerant when tried. It is but a few years ago, and your bar rebelled
at the thought of an Irishman being made Master of the Rolls in England,
and that Irishman, Plunkett.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I must say,&rdquo; burst in the Attorney-General, fresh from his first session
in Parliament, and, more still, his first season in town, &ldquo;this is but a
prejudice,&mdash;an unjust prejudice. I can assert for myself that I never
rose in the House without experiencing a degree of attention,&mdash;a
deference, in short&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Eminently the right of one whose opinions were so valuable,&rdquo; said the
Secretary, bowing blandly, and smiling.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You did not lash them too often nor too much, Hutchard,&rdquo; said the dark
man. &ldquo;If I remember aright, you rose once in the session, and that was to
move an adjournment.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, Lindley,&rdquo; said the other, good-humoredly, &ldquo;you are an unforgiving
enemy.&rdquo; Then, turning to the Chief Secretary, he said: &ldquo;He cannot pardon
my efforts, successful as they have been, to enable the Fellows of the
University to marry. He obtained his fellowship as a safe retirement, and
now discovers that his immunity is worth nothing.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I beg pardon,&rdquo; said Lindley; &ldquo;I have forgiven you long ago. It was from
your arguments in its favor the measure was so long resisted. You are
really blameless in the matter!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The sharp give and take of these sallies&mdash;the fruit of those
intimacies which small localities produce&mdash;rather astonished the
English officials, and the Secretary and the Commissioner exchanged
glances of significant import; nor was this lost on the Chief Baron, who,
to change the topic, suddenly asked,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who bought that estate&mdash;Kellett's Court, I think they call it&mdash;was
sold this morning?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I purchased it in trust,&rdquo; said Dunn, &ldquo;for an English peer.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Does he intend ever to reside there?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He talks of it, my Lord,&rdquo; said Dunn, &ldquo;the way men talk of something very
meritorious that they mean to do&mdash;one day or other.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It went, I hear, for half its value,&rdquo; remarked some one.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A great deal above that, I assure you,&rdquo; said Dunn. &ldquo;Indeed, as property
is selling now, I should not call the price a bad one.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Evidently Mr. Kellett was not of your mind,&rdquo; said the former speaker,
laughing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'm told he burst into court to-day and abused every one, from the Bench
to the crier, called the sale a robbery, and the judge a knave.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not exactly that. He did, it is true, interrupt the order of the Court,
but the sale was already concluded. He used very violent language, and so
far forgot his respect for the Bench as to incur the penalty of a
committal.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And was he committed?&rdquo; asked the Secretary.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He was; but rather as a measure of precaution than punishment. The Court
suspected him to be insane.&rdquo; Here Dunn leaned over and whispered a few
words in the Secretary's ear. &ldquo;Nor was it without difficulty,&rdquo; muttered
he, in a low tone. &ldquo;He continued to inveigh in the most violent tone
against us all; declared he 'd never leave the Jail without a public
apology from the Bench; and, in fact, conducted himself so extravagantly
that I half suspected the judge to be right, and that there was some
derangement in the case.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I remember Paul Kellett at the head of the grand jury of his county,&rdquo;
 said one.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He was high sheriff the first year I went that circuit,&rdquo; said the judge.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And how has it ended?&mdash;where is he now?&rdquo; whispered the Secretary.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I persuaded him to come home here with me, and after a little calming
down he became reasonable and has gone to his own house, but only within
the last hour. It was that my servant whispered me, when he last brought
in the wine.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And I suppose, after all,&rdquo; said the Poor-Law Commissioner, &ldquo;there was
nothing peculiar in this instance; his case was one of thousands.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Quite true, sir,&rdquo; said Lindley. &ldquo;Statistical tables can take no note of
such-like applicants for out-door relief; all are classified as paupers.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It must be acknowledged,&rdquo; said the Secretary, in a tone of half rebuke,
&ldquo;that the law has worked admirably; there is but one opinion on that
subject in England.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I should be greatly surprised were it otherwise,&rdquo; said Lindley; &ldquo;I never
heard that the Cornish fishermen disparaged shipwrecks!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who is that gentleman?&rdquo; whispered the Secretary to Dunn.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A gentleman very desirous to be Crown Prosecutor at Melbourne,&rdquo; said
Dunn, with a smile.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He expresses himself somewhat freely,&rdquo; whispered the other.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Only here, sir,&mdash;only here, I assure you. He is our stanchest
supporter in the College.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course we shall take Sebastopol, sir,&rdquo; said a colonel from the end of
the table. &ldquo;The Russians are already on half rations, and their ammunition
is nigh exhausted.&rdquo; And now ensued a lively discussion of military events,
wherein the speakers displayed as much confidence as skill.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It strikes me,&rdquo; said Lindley, &ldquo;we are at war with the Emperor Nicholas
for practising pretty much the same policy we approve of so strenuously
for ourselves. He wanted to treat Turkey like an encumbered estate. There
was the impoverished proprietor, the beggared tenantry, the incapacity for
improvement,&mdash;all the hackneyed arguments, in fact, for selling out
the Sultan that we employ so triumphantly against the Irish gentleman.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said the Attorney-General, &ldquo;he wanted to take forcible
possession.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nothing of the kind. He was as ready to offer compensation as we
ourselves are when we superannuate a clerk or suppress an office. His sole
mistake was that he proposed a robbery at the unlucky moment that the
nation had taken its periodical attack of virtue,&mdash;we were in the
height of our honest paroxysm when he asked us to be knaves; and hence all
that has followed.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You estimate our national morality somewhat cheaply, sir,&rdquo; said the
Commissioner.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;As to morals, I think we are good political economists. We buy cheaply,
and endeavor, at least, to sell in the dearest markets.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No more wine, thank you,&rdquo; said the Secretary, rising. &ldquo;A cup of coffee,
with pleasure.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It was a part of Davenport Dunn's policy to sprinkle his dinner company
with men like Lindley. They were what physicians call a sort of mild
irritants, and occasionally very useful in their way; but, in the present
instance, he rather suspected that the application had been pushed too
far, and he approached the Secretary in the drawing-room with a kind of
half apology for his guest.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ireland,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;has always possessed two species of place-hunters:
the one, patiently supporting Government for years, look calmly for the
recognition of their services as a debt to be paid; the other, by an
irritating course of action, seem to indicate how vexatious and annoying
they may prove if not satisfactorily dealt with. Lindley is one of these,
and he ought to be provided for.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I declare to you, Dunn,&rdquo; said the Secretary, as he drew his arm within
the other's, and walked with him into the back drawing-room, &ldquo;these kind
of men make government very difficult in Ireland. There is no reserve&mdash;no
caution about them. They compromise one at every step. You are the only
Irishman I ever met who would seem to understand the necessity of
reserve.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Dunn bowed twice. It was like the acknowledgment of what he felt to be a
right.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I go further,&rdquo; said the other, warming; &ldquo;you are the only man here who
has given us real and effective support, and yet never asked for
anything.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What could I wish for better than to see the country governed as it is?&rdquo;
 said Dunn, courteously.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;All are not inspired so patriotically, Dunn. Personal advantages have
their influence on most men.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course,&mdash;naturally enough. But I stand in no need of aid in this
respect I don't want for means. I could n't, if you offered it, take
office; my hands are too full already, and of work which another might not
be able to carry out. Rank, of course&mdash;distinction&mdash;&rdquo; and he
stopped, and seemed confused.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, come, we might meet you there, Dunn,&rdquo; said the other, coaxingly.
&ldquo;Be frank with me. What do you wish for?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My family is of humble origin, it is true,&rdquo; said Dunn; &ldquo;but, without
invidious reflection, I might point to some others&mdash;&rdquo; Again he
hesitated.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>That</i> need not be an obstacle,&rdquo; said the Secretary.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, then, on the score of fortune, there are some poorer than myself in&mdash;in&mdash;&rdquo;
 He stopped again.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very few as wealthy, I should say, Dunn,&mdash;very few, indeed. Let me
only know your wishes. I feel certain how they will be treated.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am aware,&rdquo; said Dunn, with some energy, &ldquo;that you incur the risk of
some attack in anything you would do for me. I am necessarily in scant
favor with a large party here. They would <i>assail you</i>, they would <i>vilify
me</i>; but that would pass over. A few weeks&mdash;a few months at
furthest&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure,&mdash;perfectly correct It would be mere momentary clamor.
Sir Davenport Dunn, Baronet, would survive&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I beg pardon,&rdquo; said Dunn, in a voice tremulous with emotion. &ldquo;I don't
think I heard you aright; I trust, at least, I did not.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The Secretary looked quickly in his face, and saw it pale, the lips
slightly quivering, and the brow contracted.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was saying,&rdquo; said he, in a voice broken and uncertain, &ldquo;that I 'm sure
the Premier would not refuse to recommend you to her Majesty for a
baronetcy.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;May I make so bold as to ask if you have already held any conversation
with the Minister on this subject?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;None, whatever. I assure you, most solemnly, that I have no instructions
on the subject, nor have I ever had any conversation with him on the
matter.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then let me beg you to forget what has just passed between us. It is,
after all, mere chit-chat. That's a Susterman's, that portrait you are
looking at,&rdquo; said he, eager to change the topic. &ldquo;It is said to be a
likeness of Bianca Capello.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A very charming picture, indeed; purchased, I suppose, in your last visit
abroad.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; I bought it at Verona. Its companion, yonder, was a present from the
Archduke Stephen, in recognition, as he was gracious enough to call it, of
some counsels I had given the Government engineers about drainage in
Hungary. Despotic governments, as we like to term them, have this merit,
at least,&mdash;they confer acts of munificent generosity.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The Secretary muttered an assent, and looked confused.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I reaped a perfect harvest of crosses and decorations,&rdquo; continued Dunn,
&ldquo;during my tour. I have got cordons from countries I should be puzzled to
point out on the map, and am a noble in almost every land of Europe but my
own.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ours is the solitary one where the distinction is not a mere title,&rdquo; said
the other, &ldquo;and, consequently, there are graver considerations about
conferring it than if it were a mere act of courtesy.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where power is already acquired there is often good policy in
legitimatizing it,&rdquo; said Dunn, gravely. &ldquo;They say that even the Church of
Rome knows how to affiliate a heresy.&mdash;Well, Clowes, what is it?&rdquo;
 asked he of the butler, who stood awaiting a favorable moment to address
him. He now drew nigh, and whispered some words in his ear.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But you said I was engaged&mdash;that I had company with me?&rdquo; said Dunn,
in reply.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir, but she persisted in saying that if I brought up her name you
would certainly see her, were it but for a moment This is her card.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Miss Kellett,&rdquo; said Dunn to himself. &ldquo;Very well. Show her into the study,
I will come down.&mdash;It is the daughter of that unfortunate gentleman
we were speaking of awhile ago,&rdquo; said he, showing the card. &ldquo;I suppose
some new disaster has befallen him. Will you excuse me for a moment?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
As Dunn slowly descended the stairs, a very strange conflict was at work
within him. From his very boyhood there had possessed him a stern
sentiment of vengeance against the Kellett family. It was the daily lesson
his father repeated to him. It grew with his years, and vague and
unmeaning as it appeared, it had the force of an instinct. His own memory
failed him as to all the circumstances of an early insult, but enough
remained to make him know that he had been ignominiously treated and
expelled from the house. In the great career of his life, with absorbing
cares and high interests around him, he had little time for such memories,
but in moments of solitude or of depression the thought would come up, and
a sense of vindictive pleasure fill him, as he remembered, in the stern
words of his father, where was <i>he</i>, and where were <i>they?</i> In
the protection he had that very day assumed to throw over Kellett in the
Court, there was the sentiment of an insolent triumph; and here was again
the daughter of the once proud man supplicating an interview with him.
</p>
<p>
These were his thoughts as he entered the room where Sybella Kellett was
standing near the fire. She had taken off her bonnet, and as her long hair
fell down, and her dripping clothes clung to her, the picture of poverty
and destitution her appearance conveyed revolted against the sentiment
which had so lately filled him, and it was in a voice of gentle meaning he
asked her to be seated.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Can you tell me of my father, sir?&rdquo; said she, eagerly, and not heeding
his words; &ldquo;he left home early this morning, and has never returned.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I can tell you everything, Miss Kellett,&rdquo; said he, in a kind voice. &ldquo;It
will reassure you at once when I say he is well. Before this he is at home
again.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The young girl clasped her hands closely, and her pale lips murmured some
faint words.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;In a moment of excitement this morning he said something to offend the
Court. It was an emergency to try a calmer temper, perhaps, than his;
indeed, he ought not to have been there; at all events, he was betrayed
into expressions which could not be passed over in mere silence, and he
was committed&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To prison?&rdquo; said she, faintly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, he was taken into custody, but only for a few hours. I obtained his
release soon after the Court rose. The difficulty was to make him accept
of his liberation. Far from having calmed down, his passion had only
increased, and it was only after much entreaty that he consented to leave
the jail and come here with me. In fact, it was under the pretence of
drawing up a formal protest against his arrest that he did come, and he
has been employed in this manner till about an hour ago, when one of my
clerks took charge of him to convey him home. A little quietness and a
little rest will restore him perfectly, however, and I have no doubt
to-morrow or next day will leave no trace of this excitement.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have been most kind,&rdquo; said she, rising, &ldquo;and I am very grateful for
it. We owe much to you already, and this last but increases the debt.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Dunn stood silently contemplating her, as she replaced her bonnet and
prepared for the road. At last he said, &ldquo;Have you come all this way on
foot and alone?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;On foot, but not alone; a comrade of my brother's&mdash;a fellow-soldier
of his&mdash;kindly gave me his escort. He is waiting for me now without.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, then, the adventure has had its compensation to a certain degree,&rdquo;
 said Dunn, with a smile of raillery.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Either I do not understand you, or you mistake me,&mdash;which is it?&rdquo;
 said she, boldly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My dear young lady,&rdquo; said Dunn, hastily, &ldquo;do not let me offend you. There
is everything in what you have done this night to secure you respect and
esteem. We live in a time when there is wonderfully little of personal
devotion; and commonplace men like myself may well misjudge its
sacrifices.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And yet it is precisely from you I should have expected the reverse. If
great minds are tainted with littleness, where are we to look for high and
noble sentiments?&rdquo; She moved towards the door as she spoke; and Dunn,
anticipating her, said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do not go for a moment; let me offer you some refreshment, even a glass
of wine. Well, then, your friend? It is scarcely courteous to leave him
outside in such weather.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pray forgive me not accepting your offer; but I am impatient to be at
home again. My father, too, will be distressed at my absence.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I will send my carriage with you; you shall not walk,&rdquo; said he,
ringing the bell.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do not think me ungrateful, but I had rather return as I came. You have
no idea, sir, how painfully kindness comes to hearts like ours. A sense of
pride sustains us through many a trial; break down this, and we are
helpless.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is it that you will accept nothing at my hands,&mdash;even the most
commonplace of attentions? Well, I'll try if I cannot be more fortunate
elsewhere;&rdquo; and so saying, he hurried at once from the room. Before
Sybella could well reflect on his words, he was back again, followed by
Charles Conway.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Miss Kellett was disposed to test your Crimean habits again, my good
fellow,&rdquo; said Dunn, &ldquo;by keeping you out there under this terrible rain,
and I perceive you have got some rough treatment already;&rdquo; and he looked
at the armless sleeve of his jacket.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Conway, laughing, &ldquo;a piece of Russian politeness!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Few as were the words, the tone and manner of the speaker struck Dunn with
astonishment, and he said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Have you been long in the service?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Some years,&rdquo; was the short reply.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's very strange,&rdquo; said Dunn, regarding him fixedly, &ldquo;but your features
are quite familiar to me. You are very like a young officer who cut such a
dash here formerly,&mdash;a spendthrift fellow, in a Lancer regiment.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pray don't involve yourself in any difficulty,&rdquo; said Conway, &ldquo;for,
perhaps&mdash;indeed, I 'm convinced&mdash;you are describing myself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Conway, of the Twelfth?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The same, at your service,&mdash;at least, in so far as being ruined and
one-armed means the same with the fellow who had a good fortune, and two
hands to scatter it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I must go. I 'm impatient to be away,&rdquo; said Sybella, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then there is the carriage at the door,&rdquo; said Dunn. &ldquo;This time I have
resolved to have my way;&rdquo; and he gave her his arm courteously to conduct
her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Could you call upon me to-morrow&mdash;could you breakfast with me, Mr.
Conway?&rdquo; said Dunn, as he gave him his hand at parting; &ldquo;my request is
connected with a subject of great importance to yourself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'm your man,&rdquo; said Conway, as he followed Sybella into the carriage.
And away they drove.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXIII. A BREAKFAST-TABLE
</h2>
<p>
When, punctual to the appointed time, Charles Conway presented himself at
Mr. Dunn's door, he learned to his astonishment that that gentleman had
gone out an hour before to breakfast with the Chief Secretary in the Park.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I came by invitation to breakfast with your master,&rdquo; said he.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Possibly so,&rdquo; said Clowes, scanning the simply clad soldier before him.
&ldquo;He never mentioned it to me; that's all I know.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Conway stood for a moment, half uncertain what to say; then, with a quiet
smile, he said, &ldquo;Pray tell him that I was here,&mdash;my name is Conway.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;As to the breakfast part of the matter,&rdquo; said Clowes, who felt &ldquo;rather
struck&rdquo; by something in the soldier's manner, as he afterwards expressed
it, &ldquo;I 'm just about to take mine; you might as well join me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Conway looked him full in the face,&mdash;such a stare was it as a man
gives when he questions the accuracy of his own senses; a slight flush
then rose to his cheek, and his lip curled, and then, with a saucy laugh
that seemed to combat the passing irritation he was suffering, he said,
&ldquo;It's not a bad notion, after all; I'm your man.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Now, though Mr. Clowes had anticipated a very different reception to his
politeness, he said nothing, but led the way into his sanctum, trusting to
the locality and its arrangement to have their due effect upon his guest.
Indeed, in this respect, he did but fair justice to the comforts around
him.
</p>
<p>
The breakfast-table, placed close to a cheerful fire, was spread with
every luxury of that meal. A small spirit lamp burned under a dish of most
appetizing cutlets, in the midst of various kinds of bread, and different
sorts of preserves. The grateful odor of mocha mingled with the purer
perfume of fresh flowers, which, although in midwinter, were never wanting
at Mr. Clowes's breakfast-table, while in the centre rose a splendid
pineapple, the first of the season, duly offered by the gardener to the
grand vizier of Davenport Dunn.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I can promise you a better breakfast than <i>he</i> would have given
you,&rdquo; said Clowes, as he motioned his guest to a seat, while he
significantly jerked his thumb towards Dunn's study. &ldquo;<i>He</i> takes tea
and dry toast, and he quite forgets to order anything else. He has some
crank or other about beginning the day with a light meal; quite a mistake,&mdash;don't
you think so?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;This is not the most favorable moment to make me a convert to that
opinion,&rdquo; said Conway, laughing. &ldquo;I must confess I incline to <i>your</i>
side of the controversy.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There are herrings there,&rdquo; said Clowes, &ldquo;and a spatchcock coming. You
see,&rdquo; continued he, returning to the discussion, &ldquo;he overworks&mdash;he
does too much&mdash;taxes his powers beyond their strength&mdash;beyond
any man's strength;&rdquo; and here Mr. Clowes threw himself back in his chair,
and looked pompously before him, as though to say, Even Clowes would n't
have constitution for what <i>he</i> does.&mdash;&ldquo;A man must have his
natural rest, sir, and his natural support;&rdquo; and in evidence of the last,
he re-helped himself to the Strasburg pâté.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your words are wisdom, and washed down with such Bordeaux I 'd like to
see who 'd gainsay them,&rdquo; said Conway, with a droll twinkle of the eye.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Better coffee, that, I fancy, than you got in the Crimea,&rdquo; said Clowes,
pointing to the coffee-pot.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I suspect Lord Raglan himself never saw such a breakfast as this. May I
ask if it be your every-day meal?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We change slightly with the seasons. Oysters and Sauterne suit spring;
and then, when summer sets in, we lean towards the subacid fruits and
claret-cup. Dash your pineapple with a little rum,&mdash;it's very old,
and quite a liqueur.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;This must be a very jolly life of yours,&rdquo; said Conway, as he lighted his
cigarette and placed his feet on the fender.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You 'd prefer it to the trenches or the rifle-pits, I suspect,&rdquo; said
Clowes, laughing, &ldquo;and small blame to you. It was out there you lost your
arm, I suppose?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Conway nodded, and puffed on in silence.
</p>
<p>
<a name="linkimage-0010" id="linkimage-0010">

</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
<img src="images/10270.jpg" width="100%" alt="270 " />
</div>
<p>
&ldquo;A bad business,&mdash;a bad business we 're making of it all! The Crimea
was a mistake; we should have marched direct to Moscow,&mdash;Moscow or St
Petersburg,&mdash;I don't care which.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nor should I, if we could get there,&rdquo; said Conway, quietly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Get there,&mdash;and why not? Fifty thousand British bayonets are a match
for the world in arms. It is a head we want, sir,&mdash;capacity to deal
with the great questions of strategy. Even you yourself must have remarked
that we have no generalship,&mdash;no guidance&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I won't say that,&rdquo; said Conway, quietly. &ldquo;We're knocking hard at
Sebastopol, and all we can say is we have n't found the weak spot yet.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The weak spot! Why, it 's all weak,&mdash;earthworks, nothing but
earthworks! Now, don't tell me that Wellington would have minded
earthworks! Ah, we have fallen upon sad times!&rdquo; sighed he, piteously. &ldquo;Our
land commanders say earthworks are impregnable; our admirals say stone
walls can't be attacked.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Conway laughed again, and lighted a fresh cigarette.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what pension have you for that?&rdquo; asked Clowes, glancing at the empty
sleeve.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A mere trifle; I can't exactly tell you, for I have not applied for it&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I would, though; I 'd have it out of them, and I 'd have whatever I
could, besides. They 'd not give <i>you</i> the Bath; that they keep for
gentlemen&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Conway took his cigar from his lips, and while his cheek burned, he seemed
about to reply; then, resuming his smoking, he lay back and said nothing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said Clowes, &ldquo;there must be distinctions of rank. One
regrets, one deplores, but can't help it Look at all the attempts at
equality, and see their failures. No, sir, you have <i>your</i> place in
the social scale, and I have <i>mine</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Now, when Mr. Clowes had enunciated this sentiment, he seemed suddenly to
be struck by its severity; for he added, &ldquo;Not but that every man is
respectable in his own rank; don't imagine that I look down upon you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Conway's eyes opened widely as he stared at him, and he puffed his cigar a
little more energetically, but never spoke.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You 've done with the service, I suppose?&rdquo; said Clowes, after a while.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm afraid so,&rdquo; said Conway, sighing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, <i>he</i>&rdquo;&mdash;and he jerked his thumb towards Dunn's room&mdash;&ldquo;he
is the man to help you to something snug. He can give away places every
hour of the day. Ay, sir,&rdquo; said he, warming, &ldquo;he can make anything, from
an archbishop to a barony constable.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I rather fear that my capacity for employment might not be found very
remarkable. I have idle habits and ways,&rdquo; said Conway, smiling.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bad things, my friend,&mdash;bad things for any man, but especially for a
poor one. I myself began life in an humble way,&mdash;true, I assure you;
but with industry, zeal, and attention, I am what you see me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That <i>is</i> encouraging, certainly,&rdquo; said Conway, gravely.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is so, and I mention it for your advantage.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Charles Conway now arose, and threw the half-smoked cigar into the fire.
The movement betokened impatience, and, sooth to say, he was half angry
with himself; for, while disposed to laugh at the vanity and conceit of
the worthy butler, he still felt that he was his guest, and that such
ridicule was ill applied to one whose salt he had eaten.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You're not going without seeing him?&rdquo; said Clowes. &ldquo;He 's sure to be in
before noon. We are to receive the Harbor Commissioners exactly at
twelve.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have a call to make, and at some distance off in the country, this
morning.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, if I can be of any use to you, just tell me,&rdquo; said Clowes,
good-naturedly. &ldquo;My position here&mdash;one of trust and confidence, you
may imagine&mdash;gives me many an opportunity to serve a friend; and I
like you. I was taken with your manner as you came into the hall this
morning, and I said to myself, 'There 's good stuff in that young fellow,
whoever he is.' And I ain't wrong. You have some blood in you, I'll be
bound.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We used to be rather bumptious about family,&rdquo; said Conway, laughing; &ldquo;but
I suspect the world has taught us to get rid of some of our conceit.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Never mind the world. Pride of birth is a generous prejudice. I have
never forgotten that my grandfather, on the mother's side, was a
drysalter. But can I be of any use to you? that's the question.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'm inclined to think not; though I 'm just as grateful to you. Mr. Dunn
asked me here this morning, I suspect, to talk over the war with me. Men
naturally incline to hear what an eyewitness has to say, and he may have
fancied I could have mentioned some new fact, or suggested some new
expedient, which in these days seems such a fashionable habit, when
everybody has his advice to proffer.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Clowes, shaking his head; &ldquo;it could n't be that. <i>We</i>
have been opposed to this war from the beginning. It was all a mistake, a
dead mistake. Aberdeen agreed with us, but we were outvoted. They would
have a fight. They said we wanted something to get cotton-spinning out of
our blood; and, egad! I suspect they've got it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Our views,&rdquo; continued Clowes, pompously, &ldquo;were either a peace or a march
to St. Petersburg. This French alliance is a rotten thing, sir. That
Corsican will double on us. The very first moment any turn of fortune
gives France an advantage, <i>he 'll</i> make peace, and leave us all the
obloquy of a reluctant assent. That's <i>his</i> view,&mdash;that's mine,
too; and we are seldom mistaken.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;For all that, I wish I were back there again,&rdquo; said Conway. &ldquo;With every
one of its hardships&mdash;and they were no trifles&mdash;it was a better
life than this lounging one I lead now. Tell Mr. Dunn that I was here. Say
that I enjoyed your excellent hospitality and pleasant company; and accept
my hearty thanks for both.&rdquo; And with a cordial shake of the hand, Conway
wished him &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; and departed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's just the class of men we want in our army,&rdquo; said Clowes, as he
followed him with his eyes. &ldquo;A stamp somewhat above the common,&mdash;a
very fine young fellow too.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
In less than a quarter of an hour after Conway's departure, Davenport
Dunn's carriage drew up at his door, and Mr. Clowes hastened to receive
his master.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are they out, sir,&mdash;are they out?&rdquo; said he, eagerly, as he followed
him into the study.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dunn; &ldquo;but everything is still at sixes and sevens. Lord Derby
has been sent for, and Lord John sent for, and Lord Palmerston sent for,
but nothing decided on,&mdash;nothing done.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And how will it end?&rdquo; asked Clowes, like one waiting for the solution of
a difficulty.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who has called this morning?&rdquo; said Dunn, curtly. &ldquo;Has Lord Glengariff
been here?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, sir. Sir Jacob Harris and the Drumsna Directors are all in waiting,
and a rather promiscuous lot are in the back parlor. A young soldier, too,
was here. He fancied you had asked him to breakfast, and so I made him
join mine.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Dunn. &ldquo;I forgot all about that engagement. How
provoking! Can you find out where he is stopping?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No. But he's sure to drop in again: I half promised him a sort of
protection; and he looks a shrewd sort of fellow, and not likely to
neglect his hits.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A strange twinkle shone in Dunn's eyes as he heard this speech, and a
queer motion at the angle of his mouth accompanied it, but he never spoke
a word.
</p>
<p>
As for Conway, meanwhile, he was briskly stepping out towards Clontarf, to
inquire after poor Kellett, whose state was one to call for much anxiety.
To the intense excitement of the morning there had succeeded a dull and
apathetic condition, in which he seemed scarcely to notice anything or
anybody. A look half weary, half vacant, was in his eye; his head was
drooped; and a low muttering to himself was the only sign he gave of any
consciousness whatever. Such was his state when Conway left the cottage
late on the night before, with a promise to be back there again early the
next morning.
</p>
<p>
Conway saw that the shutters of the little drawing-room were half closed
as he entered the garden, and his quiet, cautious knock at the door
denoted the fear at his heart. From the window, partly open, came a low,
moaning sound, which, as he listened, he discovered to be the sick man's
voice.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He was just asking if you had come,&rdquo; said Bella. &ldquo;He has been talking of
poor Jack, and fancies that you have some tidings of him.&rdquo; And so saying,
she led him into the house.
</p>
<p>
Seated before the fire, in a low chair, his hands resting on his knees,
and his gaze fixed on the embers, Kellett never turned his head round as
they entered, nor did he notice Bella, as, in a soft, low voice, she
mentioned Conway's name.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He has come out to see you, dear papa; to sit with you and keep you
company, and talk about dear Jack.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; said the sick man, in a vague, purposeless tone; and Conway now took
a seat at his side, and laid one of his hands over his.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are better to-day, Captain Kellett, ain't you?&rdquo; said he, kindly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, in the same tone as before.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And will be still better to-morrow, I trust, and able to come out and
take this long walk with me we have so often promised ourselves.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Kellett turned and looked him full in the face. The expression of his
features was that of one vainly struggling with some confusion of ideas,
and earnestly endeavoring to find his way through difficulties, and a
faint, painful sigh at last showed that the attempt was a failure.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What does this state mean? Is it mere depression, or is it serious
illness?&rdquo; whispered Bella.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am not skilful enough to say,&rdquo; replied Conway, cautiously; &ldquo;but I hope
and trust it is only the effect of a shock, and will pass off as it came.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Kellett, in a tone that startled them, and for a moment they
fancied he must have overheard them; but one glance at his meaningless
features showed that they had no ground for their fears.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The evil is deeper than that,&rdquo; whispered Bella, again. &ldquo;This cold dew on
his forehead, those shiverings that pass over him from time to time, and
that look in his eye, such as I have never seen before, all betoken a
serious malady. Could you fetch a doctor,&mdash;some one in whom you place
confidence?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I do know of one, in whom I have the fullest reliance,&rdquo; said Conway,
rising hastily. &ldquo;I'll go for him at once.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Lose not a moment, then,&rdquo; said Bella, as she took the place he had just
vacated, and placed her hand on her father's, as Conway had done.
</p>
<p>
Kellett's glance slowly followed Conway to the door, and then turned fully
in Bella's face, while, with a voice of a thrilling distinctness, he said,
&ldquo;Too late, darling,&mdash;too late!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The tears gushed from Bella's eyes, and her lips trembled; but she never
uttered a word, but sat silent and motionless as before.
</p>
<p>
Kellett's eyes were now bent upon her fixedly, with an expression of deep
and affectionate interest; and he slowly drew his hand from beneath hers,
and placed his arm around her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wish he was come, darling,&rdquo; said he, at last.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who, papa?&mdash;the doctor?&rdquo; asked Bella.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The doctor!&mdash;no, not the doctor,&rdquo; said he, sighing heavily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is poor Jack you are thinking of,&rdquo; said she, affectionately.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Poor, sure enough,&rdquo; muttered he; &ldquo;we're all poor now.&rdquo; And an
inexpressible misery was in his face as he spoke.
</p>
<p>
Bella wished to speak words of comfort and encouragement; she longed to
tell him that she was ready and willing to devote herself to him; that in
a little time, and by a little effort on their part, their changed
fortunes would cease to fret them; that they would learn to see how much
of real happiness can consist with narrow means, but she knew not in what
spirit her words might be accepted; a chance phrase, an accidental
expression, might jar upon some excited feeling, and only irritate where
it was meant to soothe, and so she only pressed her lips to his hand and
was silent.
</p>
<p>
The sick man's head gradually declined lower and lower, his breathing grew
heavier, and he slept. The long dreary day dragged on its weary hours, and
still Sybella sat by her father's side watching and waiting. It was
already dusk, when a carriage stopped at the little gate and Conway got
out, and was quickly followed by another. &ldquo;The doctor, at last,&rdquo; muttered
Sybella, gently moving from her place; and Kellett awoke and looked at
him.
</p>
<p>
Conway had barely time to whisper the name of the physician in Bella's
ear, when Sir Maurice Dashwood entered. There was none of the solemn
gravity of the learned doctor, none of the catlike stealthiness of the
fashionable practitioner, in his approach. Sir Maurice advanced like a man
entering a drawing-room before a dinner-party, easy, confident, and
affable. He addressed a few words to Miss Kellett, and then placing his
chair next her father's, said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I hope my old brother officer does n't forget me. Don't you remember
Dashwood of the 43d?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The wildest chap in the regiment,&rdquo; muttered Kellett, &ldquo;though he was the
surgeon. Did you know him, sir?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I should think I did,&rdquo; said the doctor, smiling; &ldquo;he was a great chum of
yours, was n't he? You messed together in the Pyrenees for a whole
winter.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A wild chap,&mdash;could never come to any good,&rdquo; went on Kellett to
himself. &ldquo;I wonder what became of him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I can tell you, I think. Meanwhile, let me feel your pulse. No fixed pain
here,&rdquo; said he, touching the region of the heart. &ldquo;Look fully at me. Ah,
it is there you feel it,&rdquo; said he, as he touched the other's forehead; &ldquo;a
sense of weight rather than pain, isn't it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's like lead I feel it,&rdquo; said Kellett; &ldquo;and when I lay it down, I don't
think I 'll ever be able to lift it up again.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That you will, and hold it high too, Kellett,&rdquo; said the doctor, warmly.
&ldquo;You must just follow my counsels for a day or two, and we shall see a
great change in you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'll do whatever you bid me, but it's no use, doctor; but I 'll do it
for her sake there.&rdquo; And the last words were in a whisper.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's spoken like yourself, Kellett,&rdquo; said the other, cheerily. &ldquo;Now let
me have pen and ink.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
As the doctor sat down to a table, he beckoned Bella to his side, and
writing a few words rapidly on the paper before him, motioned to her to
read them.
</p>
<p>
She grasped the chair as she read the lines, and it shook beneath her
hand, while an ashy pallor spread over her features.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ask him if I might have a little brandy-and-water, Bella,&rdquo; said the sick
man.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure you may,&rdquo; said Sir Maurice; &ldquo;or, better still, a glass of
claret; and it so happens I have just the wine to suit him. Conway, come
back with me, and I 'll give you a half-dozen of it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And is there nothing&mdash;is there no&mdash;&rdquo; Bella could utter no more,
when a warning of the doctor's hand showed that her father's eyes were on
her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come here, Bella,&rdquo; said he, in a low tone,&mdash;&ldquo;come here to me.
There's a pound in my waistcoat-pocket, in my room; put a shilling inside
of it, for it's a guinea he ought to have, and gold, by rights, if we had
it. And tell him we 'll send for him if we want to see him again. Do it
delicately, darling, so as not to let him know. Say I 'm used to these
attacks; say they're in the family; say&mdash;But there, they are driving
away,&mdash;they're off! and he never waited for his fee! That's the
strangest thing of all.&rdquo; And so he fell a-thinking over this curious fact,
muttering from time to time to himself, &ldquo;I never heard of the like
before.&rdquo;

<h2>
CHAPTER XXIV. THE COTTAGE
</h2>
<p>
Davenport Dunn had but little leisure to think about Conway or poor
Kellett. A change of Ministry had just occurred in England, and men's
minds were all eagerly speculating who was &ldquo;to come in.&rdquo; Crowds of country
gentlemen flocked up to Dublin, and &ldquo;rising men&rdquo; of all shades of opinion
anxiously paraded their own claims to notice. Dunn's house was besieged
from morning to night by visitors, all firmly persuaded that he must know
more of the coming event than any one. Whether such was really the case,
or that he deemed it good policy to maintain the delusion, Dunn affected a
slight indisposition, and refused to admit any visitor. Mr. Clowes,
indeed, informed the inquirers that it was a mere passing ailment,&mdash;&ldquo;a
slight derangement in the bronchi,&rdquo; he said; but be rigidly maintained the
blockade, and suffered none to infringe it.
</p>
<p>
Of course, a hundred rumors gave their own version of this illness. It was
spleen; it was indignation; the Government had thrown him over: he had
been refused the secretaryship which he had formerly applied for. Others
averred that his attack was most serious,&mdash;an ossification or a
scirrhus of some cartilage, a thing always fatal and dreadfully painful.
Some went further. It was his prosperity was in peril. Over-speculation
had jeopardized him, and he was deep in the &ldquo;Crédit Mobilier.&rdquo; Now, all
this while, the disappointed politician, the hopeless invalid, and the
ruined speculator ate and drank well, received and wrote replies to
innumerable confidential notes from those in power, and carefully drew up
a list of such as he desired to recommend to the Government for place and
employment.
</p>
<p>
Every morning Sir Maurice Dashwood's well-appointed cab drew up at his
door, and the lively baronet would dash up the stairs to Dunn's room with
all the elasticity of youth, and more real energy than is the fortune of
one young fellow in a thousand. With a consummate knowledge of men and the
world, he was second to none in his profession. He felt he could afford to
indulge the gay and buoyant spirits with which Nature had blessed him, and
even, doctor that he was, take his share in all the sports of the field
and all the pleasures of society.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, Dunn,&rdquo; cried he, gayly, one morning, as he entered the carefully
darkened room where the other sat, surrounded with papers and deep in
affairs, &ldquo;I think you may accept your bill of health, and come out of dock
tomorrow. They are gazetted now, and the world as wise as yourself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So I mean to do,&rdquo; said Dunn. &ldquo;I intend to dine with the Chancellor. What
is said about the new Government?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very little. There is really little to say. They are nearly the same
pieces, only placed differently on the board. This trumpery cry about
'right men in right places' will lead to all kinds of confusion, since it
will eternally suggest choice, which, in plain words, means newspaper
dictation.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;As good as any other dictation: better in one respect, for it so often
recants its judgments,&rdquo; said Dunn, sarcastically.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, they are unanimous about <i>you</i> this morning. They are all
eagerly inquiring in what way the Government propose to recognize the
services of one of the ablest men and most disinterested patriots of our
day.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don't want anything from them,&rdquo; said Dunn, testily, and walking to the
window to avoid the keen, sharp glance the other bent upon him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The best way to get it when you <i>do</i> want,&rdquo; said Dash-wood. &ldquo;By the
way, what's our new Viceroy like?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A very good appointment, indeed,&rdquo; said Dunn, gravely.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don't mean that. I want to know what he is personally: is he stiff,
haughty, grave, gay, stand-off, or affable?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I should say, from what I have seen of Lord Allington, that he is one of
those men who are grave without sadness&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come, come, never mind the antithesis; does he care for society, does he
like sport, is he free-handed, or has he only come here with the
traditional policy to 'drain Ireland'?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You 'll like him much,&rdquo; said Dunn, in his natural voice, &ldquo;and he 'll like
<i>you</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Sir Maurice smiled, as though to say, &ldquo;I could answer as much for myself;&rdquo;
 and then asked, &ldquo;Have you known him long?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; that is, not very long,&rdquo; said Dunn, hesitating, &ldquo;nor very intimately.
Why do you ask?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just because I want to get something,&mdash;at once too. There's a poor
fellow, a patient of mine now,&mdash;we were brother officers once,&mdash;in
a very sad way. Your friends of the Encumbered Court have Just been
selling him out, and by the shock they have so stunned him that his brain
has been attacked; at present it does not seem so formidable, but it will
end in softening, and all the rest of it. Now, if they 'd make him
something at once,&mdash;quickly it must be,&mdash;he could drop out on
some small retired allowance,&mdash;anything, in short, that would support
him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But what is it to be?&rdquo; asked Dunn.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Whatever you like to make him. It can scarcely be a bishop, for he's not
in orders; nor a judge, for he was not called to the bar; but why not a
commissioner of something? You have them for all purposes and of all
degrees.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You take a low estimate of commissionerships, I perceive,&rdquo; said Dunn,
smiling.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They are row-boats, where two or three pull, and the rest only dip their
oars. But come, promise me you 'll look to this; take a note of the name,&mdash;Paul
Kellett a man of excellent family, and once with a large landed property.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I know him,&rdquo; said Dunn, with a peculiar significance.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And know nothing to his disadvantage, I'm certain. He was a good officer
and a kind-hearted fellow, whom we all liked. And there he is now,&rdquo; added
he, after a pause, &ldquo;with a charming girl&mdash;his daughter&mdash;and I
really don't believe they have a five-pound note in the world. You must do
this for me, Dunn. I 'm bent upon it!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'll see what can be done about it. Anything like a job is always a
difficulty.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And everything is a job here, Dunn, and no man knows better how to deal
with one.&rdquo; And so saying, and with a pleasant laugh, the gay-hearted
doctor hurried away, to carry hope, and some portion at least of his own
cheery nature, into many a darkened sick-room.
</p>
<p>
Though several names were announced with pressing entreaties for an
audience, Dunn would see no one. He continued to walk up and down the room
deep in thought, and seemed resolved that none should interrupt him. There
were events enough to occupy, cases enough to engage him,&mdash;high
questions of policy, deep matters of interest, all that can stimulate
ambition, all that can awaken energy,&mdash;and yet, amidst all, where
were his thoughts straying? They were away to the years of his early
boyhood, when he had been Paul Kellett's playfellow, and when he was
admitted&mdash;a rare honor&mdash;to the little dinner of the nursery!
What a strange thing it was that it was &ldquo;there and then&rdquo; his first studies
of life and character should have been made; that it was there and then he
first moulded himself to the temper and ways of another, conforming to
caprices and tending to inclinations not his own. Stern tyrants were these
child masters! How they <i>did</i> presume upon their high station, how
severely did they make him feel the distance between them, and what arts
did they teach him,&mdash;what subtle devices to outwit their own
imperiousness and give him the mastery over them! To these memories
succeeded others more painful still; and Dunn's brow contracted and his
lips became tight-drawn as he recollected them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I suppose even my father would allow that the debt is acquitted now,&rdquo;
 muttered he to himself. &ldquo;I 'll go and see them!&rdquo; said he, after a moment;
&ldquo;such a sight will teach me how far I have travelled in life.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He gently descended a private stair that led to the garden, and, passing
out by the stables, soon gained the street Walking rapidly on to the first
stand, he engaged a car, and started for Clontarf.
</p>
<p>
If Davenport Dunn never gave way to a passion for revenge in life, it was
in some sort because he deemed it a luxury above his means. He often
fancied to himself that the time might come when he could indulge in this
pleasure, just as now he revelled in a thousand others, which once had
seemed as remote. His theory was that he had not yet attained that
eminence whence he could dispense with all aid, and he knew not what man's
services at any moment might be useful to him. Still, with all this, he
never ceased to enjoy whatever of evil fortune befell those who even in
times past had injured him. To measure their destiny with his now, was
like striking a balance with Fate,&mdash;a balance so strong in his favor;
and when he had not actually contributed to their downfall, he deemed
himself high-minded, generous, and pure-hearted.
</p>
<p>
It was reflecting in this wise he drove along, and at last drew up at
Kellett's door; his knock was answered by Sybella herself, whose careworn
features and jaded look scarcely reminded him of her appearance when first
he saw her, flushed and excited by exercise.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I thought I'd come myself and ask after him,&rdquo; said Dunn, as he explained
the object of his visit.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He has scarce consciousness enough to thank you,&rdquo; said she, mournfully,
&ldquo;but <i>I</i> am very grateful to you;&rdquo; and she preceded him into the
room, where her father sat in the selfsame attitude as before.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He doesn't know me,&rdquo; whispered Dunn, as the sick man's gaze was turned to
him without the slightest sign of recognition,&mdash;&ldquo;he does n't know
me!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I do. I know you well, Davenport Dunn, and I know why you come here,&rdquo;
 said Kellett, with a distinctness that startled them both. &ldquo;Leave us alone
together, Bella darling; we want to talk privately.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Sybella was so astounded at this sudden show of intelligence that she
scarcely knew how to take it, or what to do; but at a gesture from Dunn,
she stepped noiselessly from the room, and left them together.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You must not excite yourself, Kellett, nor prejudice your prospect of
recovery by any exertion; there will be time enough for matters of
business hereafter&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, there won't; that's the reason I want to talk to you now,&rdquo; said
Kellett, sharply. &ldquo;I know well enough my life is short here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
<a name="linkimage-0011" id="linkimage-0011">

</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
<img src="images/10284.jpg" width="100%" alt="284 " />
</div>
<p>
Dunn began some phrase of cheering meaning; but the other stopped him
abruptly, and said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There, there, don't be losing time that way. Is that the touch of a man
long for this world?&rdquo; and he laid on the other's hand his own hot and
burning fingers. &ldquo;I said I knew why you came here, Dunn,&rdquo; continued he,
more strongly; &ldquo;it was to look at your work. Ay, just so. It was <i>you</i>
brought me to this, and you wanted to see it. Turn your eyes round the
room, and you 'll see it's poor enough. Look in at that bedroom there, and
you 'll say it could n't be much more humble! I pawned my watch yesterday;
there's all that's out of it;&rdquo; and he showed some pieces of silver and
copper mixed together in the palm of his hand; &ldquo;there's not a silver spoon
left, so that you see you 've done it well!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My dear Kellett, these words of yours have no meaning in them&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Maybe not; but maybe you understand them, for all that! Look here, now,
Dunn,&rdquo; said he, clutching his hand in his own feverish grasp; &ldquo;what the
Child begins the Man finishes! I know you well, and I 've watched you for
many a year. All your plans and schemes never deceived <i>me</i>; but it's
a house of cards you 're building, after all! What I knew about you as a
boy others may know as a man; and I would n't believe St. Peter if he told
me you only did it <i>once!</i>&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If this be not raving, it is a deliberate insult!&rdquo; muttered Dunn,
sternly, while he rudely pushed away the other's hand, and drew back his
chair.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, it's not raving, whatever it is,&rdquo; said Kellett, calmly. &ldquo;The cold
air of the earth that's opening for me clears my brain, and I know well
the words I 'm saying, and the warning I 'm giving you. Tell the people
fairly that it's only scheming you were; that the companies are a bubble
and the banks a sham; that you 're only juggling this man's credit against
that, making the people think that you have the confidence of the
Government, and the Government believe that you can do what you like with
the people. Go at once and publish it, that you are only cheating them
all, or you 'll have a gloomier ending even than this!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I came out of compassion for you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, you did n't, not a bit of it. You came to tell old Mat Dunn that the
score was wiped off; <i>he</i> came to the window here this morning and
looked in at me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My father? Impossible! He's nearly ninety, and barely able to move about
a room.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don't care for that: there he was, where you see that bush, and he
leaned on the window-sill and looked at me; and he wiped the glass, where
his breath dulled it, twice. Then I gave a shout at him that sent him off.
They had to carry him to the car outside.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is this true?&rdquo; cried Dunn, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If I had had but the strength to bring me to the window, it's little I 'd
have minded his white hair.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If you had dared!&rdquo; said Dunn, rising, and no longer able to control his
anger.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Don't go yet; I have more to say to you,&rdquo; cried he, stretching out his
hands towards him. &ldquo;You think, because your roguery is succeeding, that
you are great and respected. Not a bit; the gentlemen won't have you, and
your own sort won't have you. There's not an honest man would eat your
salt,&mdash;there's not an honest girl would bear your name. There you
stand, as much alone in the world as if you came out of another country,
and you 're the only man in Ireland does n't see it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Dunn darted from the room as the last words were uttered, and gained the
road. So overwhelmed was he by rage and astonishment that it was some
minutes ere he could remember where he was or whither he would go.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To Beldoyle,&rdquo; said he to the carman, pointing in the direction of the low
shore, where his father lived; &ldquo;drive your best pace.&rdquo; Then suddenly
changing his mind, he said, &ldquo;No, to town.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is he gone, Bella?&rdquo; said Kellett, as his daughter entered.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; and before I could thank him for his coming.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I think I said enough,&rdquo; said he, with a fierce laugh, which made her
suddenly turn and look at him.
</p>
<p>
It was all she could do to repress a sudden cry of horror; for one side of
his face was distorted by palsy, and the mouth drawn all awry.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What's this here, Bella?&rdquo; said he, trying to touch his cheek with his
hand; &ldquo;a kind of stiffness&mdash;a sort of&mdash;Eh, are you crying,
darling?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; it was something in my eye pained me,&rdquo; said she, turning away to hide
her face.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Give me a looking-glass, quickly,&rdquo; cried he.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said she, forcing a laugh; &ldquo;you have not shaved these two days,
and you are quite neglected-look-ing. You sha'n't see yourself in such a
state.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bring it this minute, I say,&rdquo; said he, passionately, and in a voice that
grew less and less articulate every moment.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now pray be patient, dearest papa.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then I'll go for it myself;&rdquo; and with these words he grasped the arm of
the chair and tried to rise.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There, there,&rdquo; said she, softly forcing him back into his seat, &ldquo;I 'll
fetch it at once. I wish you would be persuaded, dear papa&mdash;&rdquo; began
she, still holding the glass in her hands. But he snatched it rudely from
her, and placed it before him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's what it is,&rdquo; said he, at last; &ldquo;handsome Paul Kellett they used to
call me at Corfu. I wonder what they'd say now?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is a mere passing thing, a spasm of some kind.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said he, with a mocking laugh, to which the distortion imparted a
shocking expression. &ldquo;Both sides will be the same&mdash;to-morrow or next
day&mdash;I know that.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She could hear no more, but, covering her face with her hands, sobbed
bitterly.
</p>
<p>
Kellett still continued to look at himself in the glass; and whether the
contortion was produced by the malady or a passing emotion, a
half-sardonic laugh was on his features as he said, &ldquo;I was wrong when I
said I'd never be chapfallen.&rdquo;

<h2>
CHAPTER XXV. A CHURCHYARD.
</h2>
<p>
There come every now and then, in our strange climate, winter days which
imitate the spring, with softened sunlight, glistening leaves, and
warbling birds; even the streams unite in the delusion, and run clearly
along with eddying circles, making soft music among the stones. These
delicious intervals are full of pleasant influences, and the garden breath
that floats into the open drawing-room brings hope as well as health on
its wings. It was on such a morning a little funeral procession entered
the gateway of the ruined church at Kellester, and wound its way towards
an obscure corner where an open grave was seen. With the exception of one
solitary individual, it was easy to perceive that they who followed the
coffin were either the hired mourners, or some stray passers-by indulging
a sad curiosity in listlessness. It was poor Kellett's corpse was borne
along, with Conway walking after it.
</p>
<p>
The mournful task over, and the attendants gone, Conway lingered about
among the graves, now reading the sad records of surviving affection, now
stopping to listen to the high-soaring lark whose shrill notes vibrated in
the thin air. &ldquo;Poor Jack!&rdquo; thought he, aloud; &ldquo;he little knows the sad
office I have had this morning. He always was talking of home and coming
back again, and telling his dear father of all his campaigning adventures;
and so much for anticipation&mdash;beneath that little mound of earth lies
all that made the Home he dreamed of! He's almost the last of the
Albueras,&rdquo; said he, as he stood over the grave; and at the same time a
stranger drew near the spot, and, removing his hat, addressed him by name.
&ldquo;Ah! Mr. Dunn, I think?&rdquo; said Conway.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,"-said the other; &ldquo;I regret to see that I am too late. I wished to
pay the last tribute of respect to our poor friend, but unfortunately all
was over when I arrived.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You knew him intimately, I believe?&rdquo; said Conway.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;From boyhood,&rdquo; said Dunn, coughing, to conceal some embarrassment. &ldquo;Our
families were intimate; but of him, personally, I saw little: he went
abroad with his regiment, and when he returned, it was to live in a remote
part of the country, so that we seldom met.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; muttered Conway, &ldquo;he does seem to have been well-nigh
forgotten by every one. I was alone here this morning.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Such is life!&rdquo; said Dunn.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But such ought not death to be,&rdquo; rejoined Conway. &ldquo;A gallant old soldier
might well have been followed to his last billet by a few friends or
comrades; but he was poor, and that explains all!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That is a harsh judgment for one so young as you are.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No: if poor Kellett had fallen in battle, he had gone to his grave with
every honor to his memory; but he lived on in a world where other
qualities than a soldier's are valued, and he was forgotten,&mdash;that's
the whole of it!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We must think of the daughter now; something must be done for her,&rdquo; said
Dunn.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have a plan about that, if you will kindly aid me with it,&rdquo; said
Conway, blushing as he spoke. &ldquo;You are aware, perhaps, that Jack Kellett
and I were comrades. He saved my life, and risked his own to do it, and I
owe him more than life in the cheery, hearty spirit he inspired me with,
at a time when I was rather disposed to sulk with the whole world; so that
I owe him a heavy debt.&rdquo; Here he faltered, and at last stopped, and it was
only as Dunn made a gesture to him to continue, that he went on: &ldquo;Well, I
have a dear, kind old mother, living all alone in Wales,&mdash;not over
well off, to be sure, but quite able to do a kind thing, and fully as
willing. If Miss Kellett could be induced to come and stay with her,&mdash;it
might be called a visit at first,&mdash;time would gradually show them how
useful they were to each other, and they 'd find they need n't&mdash;they
could n't separate. That's my plan; will you support it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I ought to tell you, frankly, that I have no presumption to counsel Miss
Kellett. I never saw her till the night you accompanied her to my house;
we are utter strangers to each other therefore. There is, however,
sufficient in your project to recommend itself, and if anything I can add
will aid it, you may reckon upon me; but you will yourself see whether my
counsels be admissible. There is only one question I would ask,&mdash;you
'll excuse the frankness of it for the sincerity it guarantees,&mdash;Miss
Kellett, although in poverty, was the daughter of a gentleman of fortune,&mdash;all
the habits of her life were formed in that station; now, is it likely&mdash;I
mean&mdash;are your mother's circumstances&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My mother has something like a hundred a year in the world,&rdquo; broke in
Conway, hastily. &ldquo;It's a poor pittance, I know, and you would be puzzled
to say how one could eke out subsistence on it, but she manages it very
cleverly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I had really no intention to obtrude my curiosity so far,&rdquo; said Dunn,
apologizing. &ldquo;My object was to show you, generally, that Miss Kellett,
having hitherto lived in a condition of comfort&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, we 'll do our best&mdash;I mean my mother will,&rdquo; said Conway. &ldquo;Only
say you will recommend the plan, and I 'm satisfied.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And for yourself&mdash;have you no project, no scheme of life struck out?
A man so full of youth and energy should not sink into the listless
inactivity of a retired soldier.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You forget this,&rdquo; said Conway, pointing to his armless sleeve.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Many a one-armed officer leads his squadron into fire; and your services&mdash;if
properly represented, properly supported&mdash;would perhaps meet
recognition at the Horse Guards. What say you, would you serve again if
they offered you a cornetcy?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Would I?&mdash;would I bless the day that brought me the tidings? But the
question is not of <i>me</i>,&rdquo; said he, proudly; and he turned away to
leave the spot. Dunn followed him, and they walked out into the road
together. A handsome chariot, splendid in all its appointments, and drawn
by two powerful thoroughbreds, awaited the rich man's coming, and the
footman banged down the steps with ostentatious noise as he saw him
approach.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let the carriage follow,&rdquo; said Dunn to the servant, and walked on at
Conway's side. &ldquo;If it was not that I am in a position to be of service to
you, my observation would be a liberty,&rdquo; said Dunn; &ldquo;but I have some
influence with persons in power&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I must stop you at once,&rdquo; said Conway, good-humoredly. &ldquo;I belong to a
class which does not accept of favors except from personal friends; and
though I fully recognize your kind intentions towards me, remember we are
strangers to each other.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I should wish to forget that,&rdquo; said Dunn, courteously.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I should still be ungracious enough to bear it in mind. Come, come, Mr.
Dunn,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is not the topic I want you to be interested in. If
you can bring some hope and comfort into that little cottage yonder, you
will do a far greater kindness than by any service you can render one like
me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It would scarcely be advisable to do anything for a day or two?&rdquo; said
Dunn, rather asking the question.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course not. Meanwhile I'll write to my mother, and she shall herself
address Miss Kellett, or, if you think it better, she 'd come over here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We 'll think over that. Come back with me to town and eat your dinner
with me, if you have no engagement.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not to-day,&mdash;excuse me to-day. I am low and out of sorts, and I feel
as if I 'd rather be alone.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Will you let me see you to-morrow, or the day after?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The day after to-morrow be it. By that time I shall have heard from my
mother,&rdquo; said Conway. And they parted.
</p>
<p>
Long after Mr. Dunn's handsome equipage had driven away, Charles Conway
continued to linger about the neighborhood of the little cottage. The
shutters were closed, and no smoke issued from the chimney, and it looked
dreary and desolate. Again and again would he draw near the little wicket
and look into the garden. He would have given all he possessed to have
been able to ask after her,&mdash;to have seen any one who could have told
him of her,&mdash;how she bore up in her dread hour of trial; but none was
to be seen. More than once he adventured to approach the door, and timidly
stood, uncertain what to do, and then, cautiously retracing his steps, he
regained the road, again to resume his lonely watch. And so the noon
passed, and the day waned, and evening drew nigh, and there he still
lingered. He thought that when night closed in, some flickering light
might give sign of life within,&mdash;some faint indication of her his
heart was full of; but all remained dark, silent, and cheerless. Even yet
could he not bear to leave the spot, and it was already far into the night
ere he turned his steps towards Dublin.
</p>
<p>
Let us go back for a moment to Mr. Davenport Dunn, who was not the only
occupant of the handsome chariot that rolled smoothly back to town. Mr.
Driscoll sat in one corner; the blind carefully down, so as to screen him
from view.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And that was Conway!&rdquo; said he, as soon as Dunn had taken his seat.
&ldquo;Wasn't I right when I said you were sure to catch him here?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I knew as much myself,&rdquo; said Dunn, curtly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, and what is he like?&mdash;is he a chap easy to deal with?&mdash;is
he any way deep?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He's as proud as Lucifer,&mdash;that 's all I can make out of him; and
there are few things harder to manage than real pride.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, if you can't get round it,&rdquo; said Driscoll, with a sly twinkle of the
eye.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have no time for such management,&rdquo; said Dunn, stiffly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, how did he take what you said to him? Did he seem as if he 'd enter
into the business kindly?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You don't suppose that I spoke to him about his family or his fortune, do
you? Is it in a chance meeting like this that I could approach a subject
full of difficulty and complication? You have rare notions of delicacy and
address, Driscoll!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;God help me! I'm a poor crayture, but somehow I get along for all that,
and I 'm generally as far on my road at the end of the day as them that
travels with four posters.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You'd make a pretty mess of whatever required a light hand and a fine
touch, that I can tell you. The question here lies between a peer of the
realm with twelve thousand a year, and a retired soldier with eightpence a
day pension. It does not demand much thought to see where the balance
inclines.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You're forgetting one trifling matter. Who has the right to be the peer
with the twelve thousand a year?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am not forgetting it; I was going to it when you stopped me. Until we
have failed in obtaining our terms from Lord Lackington&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, but what are the terms?&rdquo; broke in Driscoll, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If you interrupt me thus at every moment, I shall never be able to
explain my meaning. The terms are for yourself to name; you may write the
figures how you please. As for me, I have views that in no way clash with
yours. And to resume: until we fail with the Viscount, we have no need of
the soldier. All that we have to think of as regards Conway is, that he
falls into no hands but our own, that he should never learn anything of
his claim, nor be within reach of such information till the hour when we
ourselves think fit to make it known to him&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He oughtn't to keep company with that daughter of Paul Kellett, then,&rdquo;
 broke in Driscoll. &ldquo;There's not a family history in the kingdom she hasn't
by heart.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have thought of that already, and there is some danger of such an
occurrence.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;As how?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Young Conway is at this very moment plotting how she may be domesticated
with his mother, somewhere in Wales, I believe.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If he's in love with her, it will be a bad business,&rdquo; said Driscoll. &ldquo;She
does be reading and writing, too, from morning till night. There's no
labor nor fatigue she's not equal to, and all the searches and inquiries
that weary others she'd go into out of pure amusement. Now, if she was
ever to be with his mother, and heard the old woman talk about family
history, she 'd be at it hard and fast next morning.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is no need she should go there.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No. But she must n't go,&mdash;must never see her.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I think I can provide for that. It will be somewhat more difficult to
take him out of the way for the present. I wish he were back in the
Crimea.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He might get killed&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, but his claim would not die. Look here, Driscoll,&rdquo; said he, slowly;
&ldquo;I ventured to tell him this morning that I would assist him with my
influence if he wishes to re-enter the service as an officer, and he
resented the offer at once as a liberty. Now, it might be managed in
another way. Leave me to think it over, and perhaps I can hit upon the
expedient. The Attorney-General is to report upon the claims to me
to-morrow, next day I'm to see Conway himself, and then you shall learn
all.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don't like all these delays,&rdquo; began Driscoll; but at a look from Dunn
he stopped, and held down his head, half angry, half abashed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You advance small loans of money on approved security, Driscoll,&rdquo; said
Dunn, with a dry expression of the mouth. &ldquo;Perhaps some of these mornings
you may be applied to for a few hundreds by a young fellow wishing to
purchase his commission,&mdash;you understand me?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I believe I do,&rdquo; said Driscoll, with a significant smile.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You 'll not be too hard on him for the terms, especially if he has any
old family papers to deposit as security,&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just so&mdash;just so. A mere nominal guarantee,&rdquo; said Driscoll, still
laughing. &ldquo;Oh, dear! but it's a queer world, and one has to work his wits
hard to live in it.&rdquo; And with this philosophic explanation of life's
trials, Mr. Driscoll took his leave of Dunn, and walked homeward.

CHAPTER XXVI. THE OSTEND PACKET
</h2>
<p>
It was a wild, stormy night, with fast-flying clouds above, and a heavy
rolling sea below, as the &ldquo;Osprey&rdquo; steamed away for Ostend, her closed
hatchways and tarpaulined sailors, as well as her sea-washed deck and
dripping cordage, telling there was &ldquo;dirty weather outside.&rdquo; Though the
waves broke over the vessel as she lay at anchor, and the short distance
between the shore and her gangway had to be effected at peril of life, the
captain had his mail, and was decided on sailing. There were but three
passengers: two went aboard with the captain; the third was already on
deck when they arrived, and leisurely paraded up and down with his cigar,
stopping occasionally to look at the lights on shore, or cast a glance
towards the wild chaos of waves that raged without.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Safe now, I suppose, Grog?&rdquo; muttered Beecher, as the vessel, loosed from
her last mooring, turned head to sea out of the harbor.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I rather suspect you are,&rdquo; said Davis, as he struck a light for his
cigar. &ldquo;Few fellows would like to swim out here with a judge's warrant in
his mouth such a night as this.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don't like it overmuch myself,&rdquo; said Beecher; &ldquo;there's a tremendous sea
out there, and she's only a cockleshell after all.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A very tidy one, sir, in a sea, I promise you,&rdquo; said the Captain,
overhearing, while with his trumpet he bellowed forth some directions to
the sailors.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You've no other passengers than ourselves, have you?&rdquo; asked Beecher.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Only that gentleman yonder,&rdquo; whispered the Captain, pointing towards the
stranger.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Few, I take it, fancy coming out in such weather,&rdquo; said Beecher.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very few, sir, if they have n't uncommonly strong reasons for crossing
the water,&rdquo; replied the Captain.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I think he had you there!&rdquo; growled Grog in his ear. &ldquo;Don't you go poking
nonsense at fellows like that. Shut up, I tell you! shut up!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I begin to feel it deuced cold here,&rdquo; said Beecher, shuddering.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come down below, then, and have something hot. I 'll make a brew and turn
in,&rdquo; said Davis, as he moved towards the ladder. &ldquo;Come along.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, I must keep the deck, no matter how cold it is. I suffer dreadfully
when I go below. Send me up a tumbler of rum-and-water, Davis, as hot as
may be.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You 'd better take your friend's advice, sir,&rdquo; said the Captain. &ldquo;It will
be dirty weather out there, and you 'll be snugger under cover.&rdquo; Beecher,
however, declined; and the Captain, crossing the deck, repeated the same
counsel to the other passenger.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, I thank you,&rdquo; said he, gayly; &ldquo;but if one of your men could spare me
a cloak or a cape, I 'd be much obliged, for I am somewhat ill-provided
against wet weather.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I can let you have a rug, with pleasure,&rdquo; said Beecher, overhearing the
request; while he drew from a recess beneath the binnacle one of those
serviceable aids to modern travel in the shape of a strong woollen
blanket.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I accept your offer most willingly, and the more so as I suspect I have
had the honor of being presented to you,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;Do I address
Mr. Annesley Beecher?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Eh?&mdash;I'm not aware&mdash;I'm not quite sure, by this light,&rdquo; began
Beecher, in considerable embarrassment, which the other as quickly
perceived, and remedied by saying,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I met you at poor Kellett's. My name is Conway.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Conway,&mdash;all right,&rdquo; said Beecher, laughing. &ldquo;I was afraid you
might be a 'dark horse,' as we say. Now that I know your colors, I'm easy
again.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Conway laughed too at the frankness of the confession, and they turned to
walk the deck together.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You mentioned Kellett. He 's gone 'toes up,' is n't he?&rdquo; said Beecher.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He is dead, poor fellow,&rdquo; said Conway, gravely. &ldquo;I expected to have met
you at his funeral.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So I should have been had it come off on a Sunday,&rdquo; said Beecher,
pleasantly; &ldquo;but as in seeing old Paul 'tucked in' they might have nabbed
me, I preferred being reported absent without leave.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;These were strong reasons, doubtless,&rdquo; said Conway, dryly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I liked the old fellow, too,&rdquo; said Beecher. &ldquo;He was a bit of a bore, to
be sure, about Arayo Molinos, and Albuera, and Soult, and Beresford, and
the rest of 'em; but he was a rare good one to help a fellow at a pinch,
and hospitable as a prince.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That I 'm sure of!&rdquo; chimed in Conway.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I know it, I can swear to it; I used to dine with him every Sunday,
regularly as the day came. I'll never forget those little tough legs of
mutton,&mdash;wherever he found them there's no saying,&mdash;and those
hard pellets of capers, like big swan-shot, washed down with table beer
and whiskey-grog, and poor Kellett thinking all the while he was giving
you haunch of venison and red hermitage.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He 'd have given them just as freely if he had them,&rdquo; broke in Conway,
half gruffly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That he would! He did so when he had it to give,&mdash;at least, so they
tell me, for I never saw the old place at Kellett's Town, or Castle
Kellett&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Kellett's Court was the name.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, to be sure, Kellett's Court. I wonder how I could forget it, for I'm
sure I heard it often enough.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;One forgets many a thing they ought to remember,&rdquo; said Conway,
significantly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Hit him again, he hasn't got no friends!&rdquo; broke in Beecher, laughing
jovially at this rebuke of himself. &ldquo;You mean, that I ought to have a
fresher memory about all old Paul's kindnesses, and you 're right there;
but if you knew how hard the world has hit <i>me</i>, how hot they 've
been giving it to me these years back, you 'd perhaps not lean so heavily
on me. Since the Epsom of '42,&rdquo; said he, solemnly, &ldquo;I never had one
chance, not one, I pledge you my sacred word of honor. I 've had my little
'innings,' you know, like every one else,&mdash;punted for five-pun-notes
with the small ones, but never a real chance. Now, I call that hard,
deuced hard.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I suppose it <i>is</i> hard,&rdquo; said Conway; but, really, it would have
been very difficult to say in what sense his words should be taken.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And when a fellow finds himself always on the wrong side of the road,&rdquo;
 said Beecher, who now fancied that he was taking a moralist's view of
life, and spoke with a philosophic solemnity,&mdash;&ldquo;I say, when a fellow
sees that, do what he will, he's never on the right horse, he begins to be
soured with the world, and to think that it's all a regular 'cross.' Not
that I ever gave in. No! ask any of the fellows up at Newmarket&mdash;ask
the whole ring&mdash;ask&mdash;&rdquo; he was going to say Grog Davis, when he
suddenly remembered the heavy judgment Conway had already fulminated on
that revered authority, and then, quickly correcting himself, he said,
&ldquo;Ask any of the legs you like what stuff A. B. 's made of,&mdash;if he
ain't hammered iron, and no mistake!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But what do you mean when you say you never gave in?&rdquo; asked Conway, half
sternly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What do I mean?&rdquo; said Beecher, repeating the words, half stunned by the
boldness of the question,&mdash;&ldquo;what do I mean? Why, I mean that they
never saw me 'down,'&mdash;that no man can say Annesley Beecher ever said
'die.' Have n't I had my soup piping hot,&mdash;spiced and peppered too!
Was n't I in for a pot on Blue Nose, when Mope ran a dead heat with
Belshazzar for the Cloudeslie,&mdash;fifteen to three in fifties twice
over, and my horse running in bandages, and an ounce of corrosive
sublimate in his stomach! Well, you 'd not believe it,&mdash;I don't ask
any one to believe it that did n't see it,&mdash;but I was as cool as I am
here, and I walked up to Lady Tinkerton's drag and ate a sandwich; and
when she said, 'Oh! Mr. Beecher, do come and tell me what to bet on,' I
said to her, 'Quicksilver's the fastest of metals, but don't back it just
now.' They had it all over the course in half an hour: 'Quicksilver's the
fastest of metals&mdash;'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm afraid I don't quite catch your meaning.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was alluding to the bucketing, you know. They 'd just given Blue Nose
corrosive sublimate, which is a kind of quicksilver.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I perceive,&rdquo; said Conway.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good,&mdash;wasn't it?&rdquo; said Beecher, chuckling. &ldquo;Let A. B. alone to
'sarve them out,'&mdash;that's what all the legs said!&rdquo; And then he heaved
a little sigh, as though to say that, after all, even wit and smartness
were only a vanity and a vexation of spirit, and that a &ldquo;good book&rdquo; was
better than them all.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I detest the whole concern,&rdquo; said Conway. &ldquo;So long as gentlemen bred and
trained to run their horses in honorable rivalry, it was a noble sport,
and well became the first squirearchy of the world; but when it
degenerated into a field for every crafty knave and trickster,&mdash;when
the low cunning of the gambler succeeded to the bold daring of the true
lover of racing,&mdash;then the turf became no better than the <i>rouge et
noir</i> table, without even the poor consolation of thinking that chance
was any element in the result.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, what would you have? It's a game where the best player wins, that's
all,&rdquo; broke in Beecher.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If you mean it is always a contest where the best horse carries away the
prize, I enter my denial to the assertion. If it were so, the legs would
have no existence, and all that classic vocabulary of 'nobbling,'
'squaring,' and so on, have no dictionary.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's all the same the whole world over,&rdquo; broke in Beecher. &ldquo;The
wide-awake ones will have the best seat on the coach.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Conway made no reply; but the increased energy with which he puffed his
cigar bespoke the impatience he was suffering under.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What became of the daughter?&rdquo; asked Beecher, abruptly; and then, not
awaiting the answer, went on: &ldquo;A deuced good-looking girl, if properly
togged out, but she had n't the slightest notion of dressing herself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Their narrow fortune may have had something to say to that,&rdquo; said Conway,
gravely.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where there's a will, there's a way,&mdash;that 's my idea. I was never
so hard up in life but I could make my tailor torn me out like a
gentleman. I take it,&rdquo; added he, returning to the former theme, &ldquo;she was a
proud one. Old Kellett was awfully afraid of doing many a thing from the
dread of her knowing it. He told me so himself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Conway, with evident pleasure in the tone.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I could have helped him fifty ways. I knew fellows who would have 'done'
his bills,&mdash;small sums, of course,&mdash;and have shoved him along
pleasantly enough, but <i>she</i> would n't have it at any price.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was not aware of that,&rdquo; remarked Conway, inviting, by his manner,
further revelations.
</p>
<p>
Beecher, however, mistaking the source of the interest he had thus
excited, and believing that his own craft and shrewdness were the
qualities that awakened respect, went on to show how conversant he was
with all financial operations amongst Jews and money-lenders, proudly
declaring that there was not a &ldquo;man on town&rdquo; knew the cent per centers as
he did.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I've had my little dealings with them,&rdquo; said he, with some vanity in the
manner. &ldquo;I 've had my paper done when there was n't a fellow on the 'turf'
could raise a guinea. You see,&rdquo; added he, lowering his voice to a whisper
that implied secrecy, &ldquo;I could do them a service no money could repay. I
was up to all that went on in life and at the clubs. When Etheridge got it
so heavy at the 'Rag,' I warned Fordyce not to advance him beyond a
hundred or two. I was the only gentleman knew Brookdale's horse could win
'the Ripsley.' The legs, of course, knew it well before the race came off.
Jemmy could have had ten thousand down for his 'book.' Ah! if you and I
had only known each other six years ago, what a stroke of work we might
have done together! Even now,&rdquo; said he, with increased warmth of voice,
&ldquo;there's a deuced deal to be done abroad. Brussels and Florence are far
from worked out; not among the foreigners, of course, but our own fellows,&mdash;the
young Oxford and Cambridge 'saps,'&mdash;the green ones waiting for their
gazette in the Guards! Where are you bound for?&mdash;what are you doing?&rdquo;
 asked he, as if a sudden thought had crossed his mind.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am endeavoring to get back to the Crimea,&rdquo; said Conway, smiling at the
prospect which the other had with such frankness opened to him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Crimea!&rdquo; exclaimed Beecher, &ldquo;why, that is downright madness; they 're
fighting away there just as fresh as ever. The very last paper I saw is
filled with an account of a Russian sortie against our lines, and a lot of
our fellows killed and wounded.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course there are hard knocks&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's all very well to talk of it that way, but I think you might have
been satisfied with what you saw, I 'd just as soon take a cab down to
Guy's, or the Middlesex Hospital, and ask one of the house-surgeons to cut
me up at his own discretion, as go amongst those Russian savages. I tell
you it don't pay,&mdash;not a bit of it!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I suppose, as to the paying part, you 're quite right; but, remember,
there are different modes of estimating the same thing. Now, I like
soldiering&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No accounting for tastes,&rdquo; broke in Beecher. &ldquo;I knew a fellow who was so
fond of the Queen's Bench Prison he would n't let his friends clear him
out; but, seriously speaking, the Crimea 's a bad book.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I should be a very happy fellow to-night if I knew how I could get back
there. I 've been trying in various ways for employment in any branch of
the service. I 'd rather be a driver in the Wagon Train than whip the
neatest four-in-hand over Epsom Downs.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There 's only one name for that,&rdquo; said Beecher; &ldquo;at least, out of
Hanwell.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'd be content to be thought mad on such terms,&rdquo; said Conway,
good-humoredly, &ldquo;and not even quarrel with those who said so!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 've got a better scheme than the Crimea in my head,&rdquo; said Beecher, in a
low, cautious voice, like one afraid of being overheard. &ldquo;I've half a mind
to tell you, though there 's one on board here would come down pretty
heavily on me for peaching.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Don't draw any indignation on yourself on <i>my</i> account,&rdquo; said
Conway, smiling. &ldquo;I'm quite unworthy of the confidence, and utterly unable
to profit by it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'm not so sure of that,&rdquo; responded Beecher. &ldquo;A fellow who has got it so
hot as you have, has always his eyes open ever after. Come a little to
this side,&rdquo; whispered he, cautiously. &ldquo;Did you remark my going forward two
or three times when I came on board?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I perceived that you did so.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You never guessed why?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; really I paid no particular attention to it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'll tell you, then,&rdquo; whispered he, still lower, &ldquo;it was to look after a
horse I 've got there. 'Mumps,' that ran such a capital second for the
Yarmouth, and ran a dead heat afterwards with Stanley's 'Cross-Bones,'
he's there!&rdquo; and his voice trembled between pride and agitation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Conway, amused at the eagerness of his manner.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There he is, disguised as a prize bull for the King of Belgium. Nobody
suspects him,&mdash;nobody could suspect him, he 's so well got up, horns
and all. Got him on board in the dark in a large roomy box, clap posters
to it on the other side, and 'tool' him along to Brussels. That's what I
call business! Now, if you wait a week or two, you can lay on him as deep
as you like. We'll let the Belgians 'in,' before we 've done with them. We
run him under the name of 'Klepper;' don't forget it,&mdash;Klepper!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I've already told you I 'm unworthy of such a confidence; you only risk
yourself when you impart a secret to indiscretion like mine.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You'd not blow us?&rdquo; cried Annesley, in terror.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The best security against my doing so accidentally is that I may be
hundreds of miles away before your races come off.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
For a minute or two Beecher's misery was extreme. He saw how his rashness
had carried him away to a foolish act of good-nature, and had not even
reaped thanks for his generosity. What would he not have given to recall
his words?&mdash;what would he not have done to obliterate their
impression? At last a sudden thought seemed to strike him, and he said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There are two of us in 'the lay,' and my 'pal' is the readiest pistol in
Europe.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'll not provoke any display of his skill, depend on 't,&rdquo; said Conway,
controlling, as well as he could, the inclination to laugh out.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He'd tumble you over like winking if you sold him. He 'd make it as short
work with myself if he suspected me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'd rather have a quieter sort of colleague,&rdquo; said Conway, dryly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh! but he's a rare one to 'work the oracle.' Solomon was a wise man&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What infernal balderdash are you at with Solomon and Samson, there?&rdquo;
 shouted out Grog Davis, who had just been looking after the horse-box in
the bow. &ldquo;Come down below, and have a glass of brandy-and-water.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'll stay where I am,&rdquo; said Beecher, sulkily, and walked away in dudgeon
from the spot.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I think I recognize your friend's voice,&rdquo; said Conway, when Beecher next
joined him. &ldquo;If I 'm right, it's a fellow I 've an old grudge against.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Don't have it out, then,&mdash;that 's all,&rdquo; broke in Beecher, hastily.
&ldquo;I 'd just as soon go into a cage and dispute a bone with one of Van
Amburgh's tigers, as I 'd 'bring <i>him</i> to book.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Make your mind easy about that,&rdquo; said Conway. &ldquo;I never go in search of
old scores. I would only say, don't leave yourself more in his power than
you can easily escape from. As for myself, it's very unlikely I shall ever
see him again.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wish you'd given up the Crimea,&rdquo; said Beecher, who, by one of the
strange caprices of his strange nature, began to feel a sort of liking for
Conway.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why should I give it up? It's the only career I 'm fit for,&mdash;if I
even be fit for that, which, indeed, the Horse Guards don't seem to think.
But I 've got an old friend in the Piedmontese service who is going out in
command of the cavalry, and I 'm on my way now to Turin to see whether he
cannot make me something,&mdash;anything, in short, from an aide-de-camp
to an orderly. Once before the enemy, it matters wonderfully little what
rank a man holds.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The chances of his being knocked over are pretty much alike,&rdquo; said
Beecher, &ldquo;if that's what you mean.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; said Conway, laughing, &ldquo;not exactly, though even in <i>that</i>
respect the calculation is equal.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
They now walked the deck step for step together in silence. The
conversation had arrived at that point whence, if not actually
confidential, it could proceed no further without becoming so, and so each
appeared to feel it, and yet neither was disposed to lead the way. Beecher
was one of those men who regard the chance persons they meet with in life
just as they would accidental spots where they halt when on a journey,&mdash;little
localities to be enjoyed at the time, and never, in all likelihood,
revisited. In this way they obtained far more of his confidence than if he
was sure to be in constant habits of intercourse with them. He felt they
were safe depositaries, just as he would have felt a lonely spot in a wood
a secure hiding-place for whatever he wanted to conceal. Now he was
already&mdash;we are unable to say why&mdash;disposed to like Conway, and
he would gladly have revealed to him much that lay heavily at his heart,&mdash;many
a weighty care, many a sore misgiving. There was yet remaining in his
nature that reverence and respect for honesty of character which survives
very often a long course of personal debasement, and he felt that Conway
was a man of honor. Such men he very well knew were usually duped and
done,&mdash;they were the victims of the sharp set he himself fraternized
with; but, with all that, there was something about them that he still
clung to, just as he might have clung to a reminiscence of his boy-days.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I take it,&rdquo; said he, at last, &ldquo;that each of us have caught it as heavily
as most fellows going. <i>You</i>, to be sure, worse than myself,&mdash;for
I was only a younger son.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>My</i> misfortunes,&rdquo; said Conway, &ldquo;were all of my own making. I
squandered a very good fortune in a few years, without ever so much as
suspecting I was in any difficulty; and, after all, the worst recollection
of the past is, how few kindnesses, how very few good-natured things a
fellow does when he leads a life of mere extravagance. I have enriched
many a money-lender, I have started half a dozen rascally servants into
smart hotel-keepers, but I can scarcely recall five cases of assistance
given to personal friends. The truth is, the most selfish fellow in the
world is the spendthrift.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That 's something new to me, I must own,&rdquo; said Beecher, thoughtfully; but
Conway paid no attention to the remark. &ldquo;My notion is this,&rdquo; said Beecher,
after a pause,&mdash;&ldquo;do what you will, say what you will, the world won't
play fair with you!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Conway shook his head dissentingly, but made no reply, and another and a
longer silence ensued.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You don't know my brother Lackington?&rdquo; said Beecher, at length.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No. I have met him in the world and at clubs, but don't know him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'll engage, however, you 've always heard him called a clever fellow, a
regular sharp fellow, and all that, just because he's the Viscount; but he
is, without exception, the greatest flat going,&mdash;never saw his way to
a good thing yet, and if you told him of one, was sure to spoil it. I 'm
going over to see him now,&rdquo; added he, after a pause.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He 's at Rome, I think, the newspapers say?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, he's stopping there for the winter.&rdquo; Another pause followed, and
Beecher threw away the end of his cigar, and, sticking an unlighted one in
his mouth, walked the deck in deep deliberation. &ldquo;I 'd like to put a case
to you for your opinion,&rdquo; said he, as though screwing himself to a great
effort. &ldquo;If you stood next to a good fortune,&mdash;next in reversion, I
mean,&mdash;and that there was a threat&mdash;just a threat, and no more&mdash;of
a suit to contest your right, would you accept of a life interest in the
property to avoid all litigation, and secure a handsome income for your
own time?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You put the case too vaguely. First of all, a mere threat would not drive
me to a compromise.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, call it more than a threat; say that actual proceedings had been
taken,&mdash;not that I believe they have; but just say so.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The matter is too complicated for my mere Yes or No to meet it; but on
the simple question of whether I should compromise a case of that nature,
I'd say No. I'd not surrender my right if I had one, and I 'd not retain
possession of that which did n't belong to me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Which means, that you 'd reject the offer of a life interest?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, on the terms you mention.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I believe you 're right. Put the bold face on, and stand the battle. Now
the real case is this. My brother Lack-ington has just been served with
notice&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Just as Beecher had uttered the last word, his arm, which rested on the
binnacle against which he was standing, was grasped with such force that
he almost cried out with the pain, and at the same instant a muttered
curse fell upon his ear.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Conway, as he waited to hear more.
</p>
<p>
Beecher muttered some unintelligible words about feeling suddenly chilled,
and &ldquo;wanting a little brandy,&rdquo; and disappeared down the stairs to the
cabin.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I heard you,&rdquo; cried Davis, as soon as the other entered,&mdash;&ldquo;I heard
you! and if I hadn't heard you with my own ears, I 'd not have believed
it! Have n't I warned you, not once but fifty times, against that
confounded peaching tongue of yours? Have n't I told you that if every act
of your life was as pure and honest as you know it is not, your own stupid
talk would make an indictment against you? You meet a fellow on the deck
of a steamer&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stop there!&rdquo; cried Beecher, whose temper was sorely tried by this attack.
&ldquo;The gentleman I talked with is an old acquaintance; he knows me,&mdash;ay,
and what's more, he knows <i>you!</i>&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Many a man knows <i>me</i>, and does not feel himself much the better for
his knowledge!&rdquo; said Davis, boldly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I believe our friend here would n't say he was the exception to
that rule,&rdquo; said Beecher, with an ironical laugh.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who is he?&mdash;what's his name?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;His name is Conway; he was a lieutenant in the 12th Lancers, but you will
remember him better as the owner of Sir Aubrey.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I remember him perfectly,&rdquo; replied Davis, with all his own composure,&mdash;&ldquo;I
remember him perfectly,&mdash;a tall, good-looking fellow, with short
moustaches. He was&mdash;except yourself&mdash;the greatest flat I ever
met in the betting-ring; and that's a strong word, Mr. Annesley Beecher,&mdash;ain't
it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I suspect you 'd scarcely like to call him a flat to-day, at least, to
his face,&rdquo; said Beecher, angrily.
</p>
<p>
A look of mingled insolence and contempt was all the answer Davis gave
this speech; and then half filling a tumbler with brandy, he drank it off,
and said slowly,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What <i>I</i> would dare to do, <i>you</i> certainly would never suspect,&mdash;that
much I 'm well aware of. What <i>you</i> would dare is easily guessed at.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don't clearly understand you,&rdquo; said Beecher, timidly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>You</i> 'd dare to draw me into a quarrel on the chance of seeing me
'bowled over,'&rdquo; said Davis, with a bitter laugh. &ldquo;<i>You</i> 'd dare to
see me stand opposite another man's pistol, and pray heartily at the same
time that his hand might n't shake, nor his wrist falter; but I've got
good business habits about me, Master Beecher. If you open that
writing-desk, you 'll own few men's papers are in better order, or more
neatly kept; and there is no satisfaction I could have to offer any one
would n't give me ample time to deposit in the hands of justice seven
forged acceptances by the Honorable Annesley Beecher, and the power of
attorney counterfeited by the same accomplished gentleman's hand.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Beecher put out his hand to catch the decanter of brandy; but Davis gently
removed the bottle, and said, &ldquo;No, no; that's only Dutch courage, man;
nerve yourself up, and learn to stand straight and manfully, and when you
say, 'Not guilty,' do it with a bold look at the jury box.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Beecher dropped into his seat, and buried his head between his hands.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I often think,&rdquo; said Davis, as he took out his cigar-case and proceeded
to choose a cigar,&mdash;&ldquo;I often think it would be a fine sight when the
swells&mdash;the fashionable world, as the newspapers call them&mdash;would
be pressing on to the Old Bailey to see one of their own set in the dock.
What nobs there would be on the Bench! All Brookes's and the Wyndham
scattered amongst the bar. The 'Illustrated News' would have a
photographic picture of you, and the descriptive fellows would come out
strong about the way you recognized your former acquaintances in court.
Egad! old Grog Davis would be quite proud to give his evidence in such
company!' How long have you been acquainted with the prisoner in the dock,
Mr. Davis?' cried he, aloud, imitating the full and imperious accents of
an examining counsel. 'I have known him upwards of fifteen years, my Lord.
We went down together to Leeds in the summer of 1840 on a little
speculation with cogged dice&mdash;'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Beecher looked up and tried to speak, but his strength failed him, and his
head fell heavily down again on the table.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There, 'liquor up,' as the Yankees say,&rdquo; cried Davis, passing the
decanter towards him. &ldquo;You 're a poor chicken-hearted creature, and don't
do much honor to your 'order.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You 'll drive me to despair yet,&rdquo; muttered Beecher, in a voice scarcely
above a whisper.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not a bit of it, man; there's pluck in despair! You 'll never go that
far!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Beecher grasped his glass convulsively; and as his eyes flashed wildly, he
seemed for a moment as if about to hurl it in the other's face. Davis's
look, however, appeared to abash him, and with a low, faint sigh he
relinquished his hold, while his head fell forward on his bosom.
</p>
<p>
Davis now drew near the fire, and with a leg on either side of it, smoked
away at his ease.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXVII. A VISIT OF CONDOLENCE
</h2>
<p>
&ldquo;I think she will <i>see</i> me,&rdquo; said Davenport Dunn, to the old woman
servant who opened the door to him at the Kelletts' cottage, &ldquo;if you will
tell her my name: Mr. Dunn,&mdash;Mr. Davenport Dunn.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She told me she 'd not see anybody, sir,&rdquo; was the obdurate reply.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; but I think when you say who it is&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She would not see that young man that was in the regiment with her
brother, and he was here every day, wet or dry, to ask after her.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, take in my card now, and I 'll answer for it she'll not refuse me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The old woman took the card half sulkily from his hand, and returned in a
few minutes to say that Miss Kellett would receive him.
</p>
<p>
Dressed in mourning of the very humblest and cheapest kind, and with all
the signs of recent suffering and sorrow about her, Sybella Kellett yet
received Mr. Dunn with a calm and quiet composure for which he was
scarcely prepared.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If I have been importunate, Miss Kellett,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is because I
desire to proffer my services to you. I feel assured that you will not
take ill this assistance on my part I would wish to be thought a friend&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You were so to my father, sir,&rdquo; said she, interrupting, while she held
her handkerchief to her eyes.
</p>
<p>
Dunn's face grew scarlet at these words, but, fortunately for him, she
could not see it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I had intended to have written to you, sir,&rdquo; said she, with recovered
composure. &ldquo;I tried to do so this morning, but my head was aching so that
I gave it up. I wanted your counsel, and indeed your assistance. I have no
need to tell you that I 'm left without means of support. I do not want to
burden relatives, with whom, besides, I have had no intercourse for years;
and my object was to ask if you could assist me to a situation as
governess, or, if not, to something more humble still. I will not be
difficult to please,&rdquo; said she, smiling sadly, &ldquo;for my pretensions are of
the very humblest.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'm aware how much you underrate them. I 'm no stranger to Miss
Kellett's abilities,&rdquo; said Dunn, bowing.
</p>
<p>
She scarcely moved her head in acknowledgment of this speech, and went on:
&ldquo;If you could insure me immediate occupation, it would serve to extricate
me from a little difficulty at this moment, and relieve me from the
embarrassment of declining ungraciously what I cannot accept of. This
letter here is an invitation from a lady in Wales to accept the
hospitality of her house for the present; and however deeply the kindness
touches me, I must not avail myself of it. You may read the letter,&rdquo; said
she, handing it to him.
</p>
<p>
Dunn perused it slowly, and, folding it up, laid it on the table again.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is most kindly worded, and speaks well for the writer,&rdquo; said he,
calmly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I feel all its kindness,&rdquo; said she, with a slight quivering of the lip.
&ldquo;It comes when such is doubly precious, but I have my reasons against
accepting it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Without daring to ask, I can assume them, Miss Kellett. I am one of those
who believe that all efforts in life to be either good or great should
strike root in independence; that he who leans upon another parts with the
best features of identity, and loses himself in suiting his tastes to
another's.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She made no reply, but a slight flush on her cheek, and an increased
brightness in her eye, showed that she gave her full concurrence to the
words.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is fortunate, Miss Kellett,&rdquo; said he, resuming, &ldquo;that I am the bearer
of a proposition which, if you approve of, meets the case at once. I have
been applied to by Lord Glengariff to find a lady who would accept the
situation of companion to his daughter. He has so far explained the
requirements he seeks for, that I can answer for Miss Kellett being
exactly everything to fulfil them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, sir!&rdquo; broke she in, &ldquo;this is in no wise what I desired. I am utterly
unfitted for such a sphere and such associations. Remember how and where
my life has been passed. I have no knowledge of life, and no experience of
society.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let me interrupt you. Lord Glengariff lives completely estranged from the
world in a remote part of the country. Lady Augusta, his only unmarried
daughter, is no longer young; they see no company; indeed, their fortune
is very limited, and all their habits of the very simplest and least
expensive. It was remembering this very seclusion, I was glad to offer you
a retreat so likely to meet your wishes.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But even my education is not what such persons would look for. I have not
one of the graceful accomplishments that adorn society. My skill as a
musician is very humble; I cannot sing at all; and though I can read some
modern languages, I scarcely speak them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do not ask me to say how much I am aware of your capacity and
acquirements, Miss Kellett. It is about two months back a little volume
came into my hands which had once been yours; how it ceased to be so I
don't choose to confess; but it was a work on the industrial resources of
Ireland, annotated and commented on by <i>you</i>. I have it still. Shall
I own to you that your notes have been already used by me in my reports,
and that I have adopted some of the suggestions in my recommendations to
Government? Nay, if you doubt me, I will give you the proof.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I left such a volume as you speak of at Mr. Hawkhaw's, and believed it
had been mislaid.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was deliberately stolen, Miss Kellett, that's the truth of it. Mr.
Driscoll chanced to see the book, and happened to show it to me. I could
not fail to be struck with it, the more as I discovered in your remarks
hints and suggestions, coupled with explanations, that none had ever
offered me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How leniently you speak of my presumption, sir!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Say, rather, how sincerely I applaud your zeal and intelligence,&mdash;the
book bespeaks both. Now, when I read it, I wished at once to make your
acquaintance. There were points wherein you were mistaken; there were
others in which you evidently see further than any of us. I felt that if
time, and leisure, and opportunity of knowledge were supplied, these were
the studies in which you might become really proficient. Lord Glengariff s
proposal came at the very moment. It was all I could desire for you,&mdash;a
quiet home, the society of those whose very breeding is acted kindliness.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, sir! do not flatter me into the belief that I am worthy of such
advantages.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The station will gain most by your association with it, take my word for
that.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
How was it that these words sent a color to her cheek and a courage to her
heart that made her for a moment forget she was poor and fatherless and
friendless? What was it, too, that made them seem less flattery than
sound, just, and due acknowledgment? He that spoke them was neither young,
nor handsome, nor fascinating in manner; and yet she felt his praise
vibrate within her heart strangely and thrillingly.
</p>
<p>
He spoke much to her about her early life,&mdash;what she had read, and
how she was led to reflect upon themes so unlikely to attract a young
girl's thoughts. By degrees, as her reserve wore off, she ventured to
confess what a charm the great men of former days possessed for her
imagination,&mdash;how their devotion, their courage, their
single-heartedness animated her with higher hopes for the time when
Ireland should have the aid of those able to guide her destinies and make
of her all that her great resources promised.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The world of contemporaries is seldom just to these,&rdquo; said Dunn, gravely;
&ldquo;they excite envy rather than attract friendship, and then they have often
few of the gifts which conciliate the prejudices around them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What matter if they can live down these prejudices?&rdquo; cried she, warmly;
then blushing at her own eagerness, she said, falteringly, &ldquo;How have I
dared to speak of these things, and to <i>you?</i>&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Dunn arose and walked to the window, and now a long pause occurred in
which neither uttered a word.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is this cottage yours, Miss Kellett?&rdquo; said he, at last.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; we had rented it, and the time expires in a week or two.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And the furniture?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was hired also, except a very few articles of little or no value.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Dunn again turned away, and seemed lost in deep thought; then, in a voice
of some uncertainty and hesitation, said: &ldquo;Your father's affairs were
complicated and confused,&mdash;there were questions of law, too, to be
determined about them,&mdash;so that, for the present, there is no saying
exactly how they stand; still, there will be a sum,&mdash;a small one,
unfortunately, but still a sum available to you, which, for present
convenience, you must allow me to advance to you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You forget, sir, that I have a brother. To him, of right, belongs
anything that remains to us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I had, indeed, forgotten that,&rdquo; said Dunn, in some confusion, &ldquo;and it was
just of him I wanted now to speak. He is serving as a soldier with a Rifle
regiment in the Crimea. Can nothing be done to bring him favorably before
the notice of his superiors? His gallantry has already attracted notice;
but as his real station is still unknown, his advancement has been merely
that accorded to the humblest merits. I will attend to it. I 'll write
about him this very day.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How I thank you!&rdquo; cried she, fervently; and she bent down and pressed her
lips to his hand.
</p>
<p>
A cold shivering passed over Dunn as he felt the hot tears that fell upon
his hand, and a strange sense of weakness oppressed him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It will make your task the lighter,&rdquo; cried she, eagerly, &ldquo;to know that
Jack is a soldier in heart and soul,&mdash;brave, daring, and
high-hearted, but with a nature gentle as a child's. There was a comrade
of his here the other day, one whose life he saved&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have seen Conway,&rdquo; said Dunn, dryly, while he scanned her features
closely.
</p>
<p>
No change of color nor voice showed that she felt the scrutiny, and in a
calm tone she went on: &ldquo;I know so little of these things that I do not
know, if my dear brother were made an officer to-morrow, whether his want
of private fortune would prevent his acceptance of the rank, but there
surely must be steps of advancement open to men poor as he is.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You may trust all to me,&rdquo; interrupted Dunn. &ldquo;Once that you consider me as
your guardian, I will neglect nothing that concerns you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, how have I deserved such kindness!&rdquo; cried she, trying to smother her
emotion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You must call me your guardian, too, and write to me as such. The world
is of such a temper that it will serve you to be thought my ward. Even
Lady Augusta Arden herself will feel the force of it.&rdquo; There was a kind of
rude energy in the way these last words were uttered that gave them a
character almost defiant.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are, then, decided that I ought to take the situation?&rdquo; said she. And
already her manner had assumed the deference of one seeking direction.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, for the present it is all that could be desired. There will be no
necessity of your continuing there if it should ever be irksome to you.
Upon this, as upon all else, I trust you will communicate freely with me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I should approach an actual duty&mdash;a task&mdash;with far more
confidence than I feel in offering to accommodate myself to the ways and
tempers of utter strangers.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but when I have told you about them they will be
strangers no longer. People are easily comprehended who have certain
strong ruling passions. They have only one, and that the very simplest of
all motives,&mdash;pride. Let me tell you of them.&rdquo; And so he drew his
chair to her side, and began to describe the Ardens.
</p>
<p>
We do not ask the reader to follow Davenport Dunn in his sketch; enough
that we say his picture was more truthful than flattering, for he
portrayed traits that had often given him offence and suffering. He tried
to speak with a sort of disinterested coldness,&mdash;a kind of
half-pitying indifference about &ldquo;ways and notions&rdquo; that people estranged
from &ldquo;much intercourse with the world <i>will</i> fall into;&rdquo; but his tone
was, in spite of himself, severe and resentful, and scarcely compensated
by his concluding words, &ldquo;though, of course, to <i>you</i> they will be
amiable and obliging.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How I wish I could see them, though only for a minute!&rdquo; said she, as he
finished.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Have you such confidence, then, in your power of detecting character at
sight?&rdquo; asked he, with a keen and furtive glance.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My gift is generally enough for my own guidance,&rdquo; said she, frankly;
&ldquo;but, to be sure, it has only been exercised amongst the country people,
and they have fewer disguises than those we call their betters.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I may write word, then, that within a week you will be ready,&rdquo; said Dunn,
rising. &ldquo;You will find in that pocket-book enough for any immediate
outlay,&mdash;nay, Miss Kellett, it is your own,&mdash;I repeat it, all
your own. I am your guardian, and no more.&rdquo; And with a stiffness of manner
that almost repelled gratitude, he took his leave and withdrew. As he
gained the door, however, he stopped, and after a moment came back into
the room. &ldquo;I should like to see you again before you leave; there are
topics I would like to speak with you on. May I come in a day or two?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Whenever and as often as you please.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Dunn took her hand and pressed it tenderly. A deep crimson overspread her
face as she said &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; and the carriage had rolled away ere she knew
that he was gone.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXVIII. THE HERMITAGE AT GLENGARIFF.
</h2>
<p>
Beside a little arm of the sea, and surrounded by lofty mountains, stood
the cottage of Lord Glengariff. It was originally built as a mere
fishing-lodge, a resting-place in the bathing-season, or a spot to visit
when it was the pleasure of its owners to affect retirement and seclusion.
Then would the Earl and his Countess and the Ladies Julia and Jemima come
down to the Hermitage with a sort of self-approving humility that seemed
to say, &ldquo;Even <i>we</i> know how to chastise pride, and vanity, and the
sinful lusts of the flesh.&rdquo; Whether it was that these seasons of
mortification became more frequent, or that they required more space, we
cannot say; but, in course of time, the hermitage extended its limbs,
first in one direction, and then in another, till at length it grew to be
a very commodious house, with ample rooms and every imaginable comfort,
Owing to the character of the architecture, too, it gained in picturesque
effect by these successive additions; and in its jutting projections, its
deep-shadowed courts, and its irregular line of roof, it presented a very
pleasing specimen of that half-Elizabethan cottage so rarely hit upon in
any regular plan. As the fortunes of the noble house declined,&mdash;the
Earl's ancestors had been amongst the most extravagant of Irish gentry,&mdash;the
ancient castle of Holt-Glengariff, where they had long resided, was sold,
and the family settled down to live at the Hermitage. At first the change
was supposed to be merely temporary,&mdash;&ldquo;they were going to live in
London or in Brighton; they were about to establish themselves in Paris;
her Ladyship was ordered to Italy,&rdquo;&mdash;a variety of rumors, in fact,
were afloat to explain that the sunshine of their presence in that lonely
glen would be but brief and short-lived. All the alterations that might be
made in the cottage or its grounds, all the facilities of approach by land
and water, all the beneficial changes in the village itself, were alluded
to as projects for the day when they would come back there; for my Lord
said he &ldquo;really liked the place,&rdquo;&mdash;a species of avowal that was
accepted by the neighborhood as the proudest encomium man could pronounce
upon their &ldquo;happy valley.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
With all these plans and intentions, it was now eighteen years, and the
Earl had never quitted the Hermitage for any longer journey than an
occasional trip to Dublin. The Countess had taken a longer road than that
over the Alps, and lay at rest in the village churchyard. The Ladies
Georgina, Arabella, and Julia had married off, and none remained but Lady
Augusta Arden, of whom we have already made brief mention to our readers
in a former chapter.
</p>
<p>
We did but scant justice to Lady Augusta when we said that she had once
been handsome: she was so still. She had fine eyes and fine teeth; a
profusion of brown hair of the very silkiest; her figure was singularly
graceful; and, baring a degree of haughtiness,&mdash;a family trait,&mdash;her
manner was unexceptionably good and pleasing. Both the Earl and his
daughter had lived too long amongst those greatly inferior to them in rank
and fortune not to conceive a very exaggerated estimate of themselves.
</p>
<p>
No Pasha was ever more absolute than my Lord in the little village beside
him; his will was a sort of firman that none dreamed of disputing; and,
indeed, the place men occupied in the esteem of their fellows there, was
little else than a reflex of how they were regarded at the Hermitage. We
never scruple to bestow a sort of derisive pity upon the savage who,
having carved his deity out of a piece of wood, sits down to worship him;
and yet, what an unconscious imitation of the red man is all our adulation
of great folks! We follow him to the very letter, not only in investing
the object of our worship with a hundred qualities that he has not, but we
make him the butt of our evil passions, and in the day of our anger and
disappointment we turn round and rend him! Not that the villagers ever
treated my Lord in this wise,&mdash;they were still in the stage &ldquo;of
worship;&rdquo; they had been at &ldquo;their offices,&rdquo; fathers and grandfathers, for
many a year, and though some were beginning to complain that their knees
were getting sore, none dreamed of getting on their legs! The fact was,
that even they who liked the religion least thought it was not worth while
abjuring the faith of their fathers, especially when they could not guess
what was to replace it; and so my Lord dictated and decided and pronounced
for the whole neighborhood; and Lady Augusta doctored and model-schooled
and loan-funded them to her heart's content. Nay, we are wrong! It was all
in the disappointed dreariness of an unsatisfied heart that she took to
benevolence! Oh, dear! what a sorry search is that after motives, if one
only knew how much philanthropy and active charity have come of a breach
of promise to marry! Not that Lady Augusta had ever stood in this
position, but either that she had looked too high, or was too hard to
please, or from some other cause, but she never married.
</p>
<p>
The man who has no taste for horsemanship consoles himself for the
unenjoyed pleasure by reading of the fractured ribs and smashed
collar-bones of the hunting-field. Was it in something of this spirit that
Lady Augusta took an especial delight in dwelling in her mind and in her
letters on all the disagreeables of her sisters' wedded life? The
extravagance of men, their selfishness, their uncomplying habits, the
odious tyranny of their tempers, were favorite themes with her, dashed
with allusions to every connubial contingency, from alimony to the measles
in the nursery! At last, possibly because, by such frequent recurrence to
the same subjects, she had no longer anything new to say on them, or
perhaps&mdash;it is just possible&mdash;that the themes themselves had
less interest for others than for herself, her sisters seemed to reply
less regularly than of old. Their answers were shorter and drier; and they
appeared neither to care so much for sympathy and condolence as formerly;
and, in fact, as Lady Augusta said to herself, &ldquo;They were growing inured
to ill-treatment!&rdquo; And if half of us in this world only knew of the
miseries we are daily suffering, and which sympathetic friends are crying
over, what a deal of delightful affliction might we enjoy that we now are
dead to! What oppressive governments do we live under, what cruel
taskmasters, what ungrateful publics, not to speak of the more touching
sorrows of domestic life,&mdash;the undervaluing parents and
unsympathizing wives! Well, one thing is a comfort: there are dear kind
hearts in mourning over all these for us, anxiously looking for the day we
may awaken to a sense of our own misery!
</p>
<p>
It was of a cheery spring morning, sunlit and breezy, when, in the
chirping songs of birds, the rustling leaves, and fast-flowing rivulets,
Nature seems to enjoy a more intense vitality, that the Earl sat at
breakfast with his daughter. A fairer prospect could hardly be seen than
that which lay before the open windows in front of them. The green lawn,
dotted with clumps of ancient trees, inclined with many a waving slope to
the sea, which in a long narrow arm pierced its way between two jutting
headlands,&mdash;the one bold, rocky, and precipitous; the other
grass-covered and flowery, reflecting its rich tints in the glassy water
beneath. The sea was, indeed, calm and still as any lake, and, save when a
low, surging sound arose within some rocky cavern, as silent and
noiseless. The cattle browsed down to the very water's edge, and the nets
of the fishermen hung to dry over the red-berried foliage of the arbutus.
They who looked&mdash;when they did, perchance, look on this scene&mdash;gazed
with almost apathy on it. Their eyes never brightened as the changing
sunlight cast new effects upon the scene. Nor was this indifference the
result of any unconsciousness of its beauty. A few months back it was the
theme of all their praises. Landscape-painters and photographers were
invited specially to catch its first morning tints, its last mellow glow
at sunset. The old Lord said it was finer than Sorrento, equal to anything
in Greece. If the Mediterranean were bluer, where was there such emerald
verdure,&mdash;where such blended coloring of heaths, purple and blue and
violet,&mdash;in what land did the fragrance of the white thorn so load
the warm atmosphere? Such, and such like, were the encomiums they were
wont to utter; and wherefore was it that they uttered them no more? The
explanation is a brief one. A commission, or a deputation, or a something
as important, had come down to examine Bantry Bay, and investigate its
fitness to become a packet station for America. In the course of this
examination, a scientific member of the body had strayed down to
Glengariff, where, being of a speculative as well as of a scientific turn,
he was struck by its immense capabilities. What a gem it was, and what
might it not be made! It was Ireland in the tropics,&mdash;&ldquo;the Green
Isle&rdquo; in the Indian Ocean! Only imagine such a spot converted into a
watering-place! With a lodge for the Queen on that slope sheltered by the
ilex-copse, crescents, and casinos, and yacht stations, and ornamental
villas rose on every side by his descriptive powers, and the old Earl&mdash;for
he was dining with him&mdash;saw at one glance how he had suddenly become
a benefactor of mankind and a millionnaire. &ldquo;That little angle of the
shore yonder, my Lord,&mdash;the space between the pointed rock and the
stone-pine trees,&mdash;is worth fifty thousand pounds; the crescent that
would stand there would leave many an untenanted house at Kemp Town. I 'll
engage myself to get you a thousand guineas for that small bit of
tableland to the right; the Duke of Uxmore is only waiting to hit upon
such a spot. Here, too, where we sit, must be the hydropathic
establishment. You can't help it, my Lord, you must comply. This park will
bring you in a princely revenue. It is gold,&mdash;actual gold,&mdash;every
foot of it! There 's not a Swiss cottage in these woods won't pay cent per
cent!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mr. Galbraith&mdash;such was his name&mdash;was of that pictorially gifted
order of which the celebrated George Robins was once chief. He knew how to
dress his descriptions with the double attraction of the picturesque and
the profitable, so that trees seemed to bend under golden fruit, and the
sea-washed rocks looked like &ldquo;nuggets.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
If there be something very seductive in the prospect of growing immensely
rich all at once, there is a terrible compensation in the utter
indifference inflicted on us as to all our accustomed pleasures in life.
The fate of Midas seems at once our own; there is nothing left to us but
that one heavy and shining metal of all created blessedness! Lord
Glengariff was wont to enjoy the lonely spot he lived in with an intense
appreciation of its beauty. He never wearied of watching the changing
effects of season on a scene so full of charm; but now he surveyed it with
a sense of fidgety impatience, eager for the time when the sounds of
bustle and business should replace the stillness that now reigned around
him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;This is from Dunn,&rdquo; said he, breaking open a large, heavy-sealed letter
which had just arrived. His eyes ran hastily along it, and he exclaimed
peevishly, &ldquo;No prospectus yet; no plan issued; nothing whatever announced.
'I have seen Galbraith, and had some conversation with him about your
harbor.' My harbor!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Lady Augusta, mildly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, the insolent upstart has not even listened to what was said to him.
My harbor! He takes it for granted that we were wanting to make this a
packet station for America, and he goes on to say that the place has none
of the requisite qualifications,&mdash;no depth of water! I wish the
fellow were at the bottom of it! Really, this is intolerable. Here is a
long lecture to me not to be misled by those 'speculation-mongers who are
amongst the rife products of our age.' I ask you, if you ever heard of
impertinence like that? This fellow&mdash;the arch-charlatan of his day,
the quack <i>par excellence</i> of his nation&mdash;dares to warn <i>me</i>
against the perils of his class and kindred! Only listen to this, Gusty,&rdquo;
 cried he, bursting into a fit of half-angry laughter: &ldquo;'I am disposed to
think that, by drawing closer to the present party in power, you could
serve your interests much more effectively than by embarking in any
schemes of mere material benefit. Allington'&mdash;he actually calls him
Allington!&mdash;'dropped hints to this effect in a confidential
conversation we held last evening together, and I am in hopes that, when
we meet, you will enter into our views.' Are the coronets of the nobility
to be put up to sale like the acres of the squirearchy? or what is it this
fellow is driving at?&rdquo; cried he, flinging down the letter in a rage, and
walking up and down the room. &ldquo;The rule of O'Connell and his followers was
mild and gentle and forbearing, compared with the sway of these fellows.
In the one case we had a fair stand-up fight,&mdash;opinion met opinion,
and the struggle was an open one; but here we have an organized
association to investigate the state of our resources, to pry into our
private affairs, learning what pressure bears upon us here, what weak spot
gives way there. They hold our creditors in leash, to slip them on us at
any moment; and the threat of a confiscation&mdash;for it is just that,
and nothing less&mdash;is unceasingly hanging over us!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He stopped short in his torrent of passion, for the white sail of a small
fishing-craft that just showed in the offing suddenly diverted his
thoughts to that vision of prosperity he so lately revelled in,&mdash;that
pleasant dream of a thriving watering-place, bright, sunny, and
prosperous, the shore dotted with gayly caparisoned donkeys, and the sea
speckled with pleasure-boats. All the elements of that gay Elysium came up
before him,&mdash;the full tide of fortune setting strongly in, and coming
to his feet. Galbraith, who revelled in millions, whose rapid calculations
rarely descended to ignoble thousands, had constantly impressed upon him
that if Dunn only took it up, the project was already accomplished. &ldquo;He'll
start you a company, my Lord, in a week; a splendid prospectus and an
admirable set of names on the direction, with a paid-up capital, to begin
with, of&mdash;say £30,000. He knows to a nicety how many Stock Exchange
fellows, how many M.P.'s, how many county gentlemen to have. He 'll stick
all the plums in the right place too; and he'll have the shares quoted at
a premium before the scrip is well out in the market. Clever fellow, my
Lord,&mdash;vastly clever fellow, Dunn!&rdquo; And so the Earl thought, too,
till the letter now before him dashed that impression with disappointment.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'll tell you what it is, Gusty,&rdquo; said he, after a pause,&mdash;&ldquo;we must
ask him down here. It is only by an actual inspection of the bay that he
can form any just conception of the place. You must write to him for me.
This gouty knuckle of mine makes penwork impossible. You can say&mdash;Just
find a sheet of paper, and I 'll tell you what to say.&rdquo; Now, the noble
Earl was not as ready at dictation as he had fancied; for when Lady
Augusta had opened her writing-desk, arranged her writing-materials, and
sat, pen in hand, awaiting his suggestions, he was still pacing up and
down the room, muttering to himself in broken and unconnected phrases,
quite unsuited to the easy flow of composition. &ldquo;I suppose, Gusty,&mdash;I
take it for granted,&mdash;you must begin, 'My dear sir,'&mdash;eh?&mdash;or,
perhaps, better still, 'Dear Mr. Dunn.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;'Dear Mr. Dunn,'&rdquo; said she, not looking up from the paper, but quietly
retouching the last letters with her pen.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I don't see why, after all, we should follow this foolish lead,&rdquo; said
he, proudly. &ldquo;The acceptance he meets from others need not dictate to us,
Gusty. I 'd say, 'The Earl of Glengariff'&mdash;or, 'I am requested by
Lord Glen-gariff&mdash;'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;'My father, Lord Glengariff,'&rdquo; interposed she, quietly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It sounds more civilly, perhaps. Be it so;&rdquo; and again he walked up and
down, in the same hard conflict of composition. At length he burst forth:
&ldquo;There 's nothing on earth more difficult than addressing a man of this
sort. You want his intimacy without familiarity. You wish to be able to
obtain the benefit of his advice, and yet not incur the infliction of his
dictation. In fact, you are perfectly prepared to treat him as a valued
guest, provided he never lapses into the delusion that he is your friend.
Now, it would take old Metternich to write the sort of note I mean.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If I apprehend you, your wish is to ask him down here on a visit of a few
days, with the intimation that you have a matter of business to
communicate&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said he, impatiently, &ldquo;that's very true. The business part of
the matter should come in incidentally, and yet the tone of the invitation
be such as to let him distinctly understand that he does not come without
an express object Now you have my meaning, Gusty,&rdquo; said he, with the
triumphant air of one who had just surmounted a difficulty.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If I have, then, I am as far as ever from knowing how to convey it,&rdquo; said
she, half peevishly. &ldquo;I'd simply say, 'Dear Sir,' or, 'Dear Mr. Dunn,&mdash;There
is a question of great moment to myself, on which your advice and counsel
would be most valuable to me. If you could spare me the few days a visit
would cost you, and while giving us the great pleasure of your society&mdash;'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Too flattering, by half. No, no,&rdquo; broke he in again. &ldquo;I 'll tell you what
would be the effect of all that, Gusty,&rdquo;&mdash;and his voice swelled out
full and forcibly,&mdash;&ldquo;the fellow would come here, and, before a week
was over, he 'd call me Glengariff!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She grew crimson over face and forehead and neck, and then almost as
quickly pale again; and, rising hastily from the table, said, &ldquo;Really, you
expect too much from my subtlety as a note-writer. I think I 'd better
request Mr. Dunn to look out for one of those invaluable creatures they
call companions, who pay your bills, correct your French notes, comb the
lapdog, and scold your maid for you. <i>She</i> might be, perhaps, equal
to all this nice diplomacy.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not a bad notion, by any means, Gusty,&rdquo; said he, quickly. &ldquo;A clever woman
would be inestimable for all the correspondence we are like to have soon;
far better than a man,&mdash;less obtrusive, more confidential, not so
open to jobbery; a great point,&mdash;a very great point. Dunn's the very
man, too, to find out the sort of person we want.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Something more than governess, and less than lady,&rdquo; said she, half
superciliously.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The very thing, Gusty,&mdash;the very thing. Why, there are women with
breeding enough to be maids of honor, and learning sufficient for a
professor, whose expectations never rise beyond a paltry hundred a year&mdash;what
am I saying?&mdash;sixty or seventy are nearer the mark. Now for it,
Gusty. Make this object the substance of your letter. You can have no
difficulty in describing what will suit us. We live in times,
unfortunately, when people of birth and station are reduced to straitened
circumstances on every hand. It reminds me of what poor Hammersley used to
say,&mdash;'Do you observe,' said he, 'that whenever there's a great smash
on the turf, you 'll always see the coaches horsed with thoroughbreds for
the next year or two!'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A very unfeeling remark, if it mean anything at all.&rdquo; &ldquo;Never mind. Write
this letter, and say at the foot of it, 'We should be much pleased if, in
your journeys 's out'&mdash;he's always coming down to Cork and the
neighborhood&mdash;you could give us a few days at Glengariff Hermitage.
My father has certain communications to make to you, which he is confident
would exempt your visit from the reproach of mere idleness.' He'll take
that; the fellow is always flattered when you seem impressed by the
immensity of his avocations!&rdquo; And with a hearty chuckle at the weakness he
was triumphing over, the old Lord left the room, while his daughter
proceeded to compose her letter.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXIX. A MORNING AT OSTEND.
</h2>
<p>
It would never have occurred to the mind of any one who saw Annesley
Beecher and Davis, as they sat at breakfast together in Ostend, that such
a scene as we have described could have occurred between them. Not only
was their tone frank and friendly with each other, but a gay and lively
spirit pervaded the conversation, and two seemingly more light-hearted
fellows it were hard to find.
</p>
<p>
As the chemist is able by the minutest drop, an almost imperceptible atom
of some subtle ingredient, to change the properties of some vast mass,
altering color and odor and taste at once, so did the great artist Grog
Davis know how to deal with the complicated nature of Beecher, that he
could at any moment hurl him down into the blackest depths of despair, or
elevate him to the highest pinnacle of hope and enjoyment. The glorious
picture of a race-course, with all its attendant rogueries, betting-stands
crammed with &ldquo;fats,&rdquo; a ring crowded with &ldquo;green-horns,&rdquo; was a tableau of
which he never wearied. Now, this was a sort of landscape Grog touched off
neatly. All the figures he introduced were life-studies, every tint and
shade and effect taken carefully from nature. With a masterly hand he
sketched out a sort of future campaign, artfully throwing Beecher himself
into the foreground, and making him fancy that he was in some sort
necessary to the great events before them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mumps did not touch his hock, I hope, when he kicked there?&rdquo; asked
Beecher.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Call him Klepper,&mdash;never forget that,&rdquo; remonstrated Grog; &ldquo;he's
remarkably like Mumps, that's all; but Mumps is in Staffordshire,&mdash;one
of the Pottery fellows has him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So he is,&rdquo; laughed Beecher, pleasantly. &ldquo;I know the man that owns him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, you don't,&rdquo; broke in Davis; &ldquo;you've only heard his name,&mdash;it is
Coulson or Cotton, or something like that. One thing, however, is certain:
he values him at twelve hundred pounds, and we 'd sell our horse for
eight.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So we would, Grog, and be on the right side of the hedge too.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He'd be dog cheap for it,&rdquo; said Davis; &ldquo;he's one of those lazy beggars
that never wear out. I 'd lay an even thousand on it that he runs this day
two years as he does to-day, and even when he has n't speed for a flat
race he 'll be a rare steeple-chase horse.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Beecher's eyes glistened, and he rubbed his hands with delight as he heard
him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I do like an ugly horse,&rdquo; resumed Davis; &ldquo;a heavy-shouldered beast, with
lob-ears, lazy eyes, and capped hocks, and if they know how to come out a
stable with a 'knuckle over' of the pastern, or a little bit lame, they
're worth their weight in gold.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
What a merry laugh was Beecher's as he listened!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Blow me!&rdquo; cried Grog, in a sort of enthusiasm, &ldquo;if some horses don't seem
born cheats,&mdash;regular legs! They drag their feet along, all weary and
tired; if you push them a bit, they shut up, or they answer the whip with
a kind of shrug, as if to say, 'It ain't any use punishing me at all,' the
while they go plodding in, at the tail of the others, till within five, or
maybe four lengths of the winning-post, and then you see them stretching&mdash;it
ain't a stride, it's a stretch&mdash;you can't say how it's done, but they
draw on&mdash;on&mdash;on, till you see half a head in front, and there
they stay&mdash;just doing it&mdash;no more.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mumps is exactly&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Klepper,&mdash;remember, he's Klepper,&rdquo; said Grog, mildly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Klepper, to be sure,&mdash;how can I forget it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I hope that fellow Conway is off,&rdquo; said Grog.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, he started by the train for Liege,&mdash;third class too,&mdash;must
be pretty hard up, I take it, to travel that way.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good enough for a fellow that has been roughing it in the ranks these two
years.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He's a gentleman, though, for all that,&rdquo; broke in Beecher.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And Strawberry ran at Doncaster, and I saw him t' other day in a 'bus.
Now, I 'd like to know how much better he is for having once been a
racer?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Blood always tells&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;In a horse, Beecher, in a horse, not in a man. Have n't I got a deal of
noble blood in my veins?&mdash;ain't I able to show a thoroughbred
pedigree?&rdquo; said he, mockingly. &ldquo;Well, let me see the fellow will stand at
eight paces from the muzzle of a rifle-pistol more cool, or who'll sight
his man more calm than I will.&rdquo; There was a tinge of defiance in the way
these words were said that by no means contributed to the ease of him who
heard them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;When do we go for Brussels, Grog?&rdquo; asked he, anxious to change the
subject.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here's the map of the country,&rdquo; said Davis, producing a card scrawled
over with lines and figures. &ldquo;Brussels, the 12th and 14th; Spa, the 20th;
Aix, the 25th. Then <i>you</i> might take a shy at Dusseldorf, <i>I</i>
can't; I winged a Prussian major there five years ago, and they won't let
me in. I 'll meet you at Wiesbaden, and we 'll have a week at the tables.
You 'll have to remember that I 'm Captain Christopher so long as we're on
the Rhine; once at Baden, 'Richard's himself again!'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is this for either of you, gentlemen?&rdquo; said the waiter, presenting an
envelope from the telegraph-office.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; I'm Captain Davis,&rdquo; said Grog, as he broke the seal.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;'Is the Dean able to preach?&mdash;may we have a collection?&mdash;Telegraph
back.&mdash;Tom,'&rdquo; read? Davis, slowly, aloud; and then added, &ldquo;Ain't he a
flat to be always telegraphing these things? As if every fellow in the
office couldn't see his game!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Spicer, is it?&rdquo; asked Beecher.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; he wants to hear how the horse is,&mdash;if there's good running in
him, and what he's to lay on; but that's no way to ask it. I mind the day,
at Wolverton, when Lord Berrydale got one of these: 'Your mother is
better,&mdash;they are giving her tonics.' And I whispered to George
Rigby, 'It 's about Butterfly his mare, that's in for the York, and that's
to say, &ldquo;She's all safe, lay heavy on it.&rdquo; And so I hedged round, and
backed her up to eight thousand,&mdash;ay, and I won my money; and when
Berrydale said to me after the race was over, 'Grog,' says he, 'you seem
to have had a glimpse of the line of country this time,' says I to him;
'Yes, my Lord,' says I; 'and I 'm glad to find the tonics agree with your
Lordship's mother.' Did n't he redden up to the roots of his hair! and
when he turned away he said, 'There's no coming up to that fellow Davis!'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I wonder you let him see that you were in his secret,&rdquo; said Beecher.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That was the way to treat <i>him</i>. If it was Baynton or Berries, I'd
not have said a word; but I knew Berrydale was sure to let me have a share
in the first good thing going just out of fear of me, and so he did; that
was the way I came to back Old Bailey.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It was now Beecher's turn to gaze with admiring wonder at this great
intelligence, and certainly his look was veneration itself.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here's another despatch,&rdquo; cried Davis, as the waiter presented another
packet like the former one. &ldquo;We 're like Secretaries of State to-day,&rdquo;
 added he, laughing, as he tore open the envelope. This time, however, he
did not read the contents aloud, but sat slowly pondering over the lines
to himself.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's not Spicer again?&rdquo; asked Beecher.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the brief reply.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nor that other fellow,&mdash;that German with the odd name?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nothing about Mumps,&mdash;Klepper, I mean,&mdash;nothing about him?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nothing; it don't concern him at all. It's not about anything you ever
heard of before,&rdquo; said Davis, as he threw a log of wood on the fire, and
kicked it with his foot. &ldquo;I 'll have to go to Brussels to-night. I 'll
have to leave this by the four o'clock train,&rdquo; said he, looking at his
watch. &ldquo;The horse is n't fit to move for twenty-four hours, so you 'll
remain here; he must n't be left without one of us, you know.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course not. But is there anything so very urgent&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I suppose a man is best judge of his own affairs,&rdquo; said Davis, rudely.
</p>
<p>
Beecher made no reply, and a long and awkward silence ensued.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let him have one of the powders in a linseed mash,&rdquo; said Davis, at last,
&ldquo;and see that the bandages are left on&mdash;only a little loose&mdash;at
night. Tom must remain with him in the box on the train, and I 'll look
out for you at the station. If we shouldn't meet, come straight to the
Hôtel Tirlemont, where all will be ready for you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Remember, Grog, I've got no money; you haven't trusted me with a single
napoleon.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I know that; here's a hundred francs. Look out sharp, for you 'll have to
account for every centime of it when we meet. Dine upstairs here, for if
you go down to the ordinary you 'll be talking to every man Jack you meet,&mdash;ay,
you know you will.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Egad! it's rather late in the day to school me on the score of manners.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'm not a-talking of manners, I 'm speaking of discretion,&mdash;of
common prudence,&mdash;things you 're not much troubled with; you 're just
as fit to go alone in life as I am to play the organ at an oratorio.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Many thanks for the flattery,&rdquo; said Beecher, laughing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What would be the good of flattering you?&rdquo; broke out Grog. &ldquo;You ain't
rich, that one could borrow from you; you haven't a great house, where one
could get dinners out of you; you 're not even the head of your family,
that one might draw something out of your rank,&mdash;you ain't anything.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Except <i>your</i> friend, Grog Davis; pray don't rob me of that
distinction,&rdquo; said Beecher, with a polished courtesy the other felt more
cutting than any common sarcasm.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's the best leaf in your book, whatever you may think of it,&rdquo; said
Davis, sternly; &ldquo;and it will be a gloomy morning for you whenever you
cease to be it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don't intend it, old fellow; I 'll never tear up the deed of
partnership, you may rely upon that. The old-established firm of Beecher
and Davis, or Davis and Beecher&mdash;for I don't care which&mdash;shall
last <i>my</i> time, at least;&rdquo; and he held out his hand with a cordiality
that even Grog felt irresistible, for he grasped and shook it heartily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If I could only get you to run straight, I 'd make a man of you,&rdquo; said
Grog, eying him fixedly. &ldquo;There's not a fellow in England could do as much
for you as I could. There's nobody knows what's in you as I do, and
there's nobody knows where you break down like <i>me</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;True, O Grog, every word of it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'd put you in the first place in the sporting world,&mdash;I 'd have
your name at the top of the list at 'the turf.' In six months from this
day&mdash;this very day&mdash;I 'd bind myself to make Annesley Beecher
the foremost man at Newmarket. But just on one condition.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And that?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You should take a solemn oath&mdash;I 'd make it a solemn one, I promise
you&mdash;never to question anything I decided in your behalf, but obey me
to the letter in whatever I ordered. Three months of that servitude, and
you 'd come out what I 've promised you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'll swear it this moment,&rdquo; cried Beecher.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Will you?&rdquo; asked Davis, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;In the most solemn and formal manner you can dictate on oath to me. I 'll
take it now, only premising you 'll not ask me anything against the laws.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nothing like hanging, nor even transportation,&rdquo; said Grog, laughing,
while Beecher's face grew crimson, and then pale. &ldquo;No,&mdash;no; all I 'll
ask is easily done, and not within a thousand miles of a misdemeanor. But
you shall Just think it over quietly. I don't want a 'catch match.' You
shall have time to reconsider what I have said, and when we meet at
Brussels you can tell me your mind.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Agreed; only I hold <i>you</i> to your bargain, remember, if <i>I</i>
don't change.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'll stand to what I've said,&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;Now, remember, the Hotel
Tirlemont; and so, good-bye, for I must pack up.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
When the door closed after him, Annesley Beecher walked the room,
discussing with himself the meaning of Davis's late words. Well did he
know that to restore himself to rank and credit and fair fame was a labor
of no common difficulty. How was he ever to get back to that station,
forfeited by so many derelictions! Davis might, it is true, get his bills
discounted,&mdash;might hit upon fifty clever expedients for raising the
wind,&mdash;might satisfy this one, compromise with that; he might even
manage so cleverly that racecourses and betting-rooms would be once more
open to him. But what did&mdash;what could Grog know of that higher world
where once he had moved, and to which, by his misdeeds, he had forfeited
all claim to return? Why, Davis did n't even know the names of those men
whose slightest words are verdicts upon character. All England was not
Ascot, and Grog only recognized a world peopled with gentlemen riders and
jocks, and a landscape dotted with flagstaffs, and closed in with a
stand-house.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said he to himself; &ldquo;that's a flight above you, Master Davis. It
's not to be thought of.&rdquo;

<h2>
CHAPTER XXX. THE OPERA.
</h2>
<p>
A dingy old den enough is the Hôtel Tirlemont, with its low-arched <i>porte-cochere</i>,
and its narrow windows, small-paned and iron-barred. It rather resembles
one of those antiquated hostels you see in the background of an Ostade or
a Teniers than the smart edifice which we nowadays look for in an hotel.
Such was certainly the opinion of Annesley Beecher as he arrived there on
the evening after that parting with Davis we have just spoken of. Twice
did he ask the guide who accompanied him if this was really the Tirlemont,
and if there were not some other hotel of the same name; and while he half
hesitated whether he should enter, a waiter respectfully stepped forward
to ask if he were the gentleman whose apartment had been ordered by
Captain Davis,&mdash;a demand to which, with a sullen assent, he yielded,
and slowly mounted the stairs.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is the Captain at home?&rdquo; asked he.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, sir; he went off to the railway station to meet you. Mademoiselle,
however, is upstairs.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mademoiselle!&rdquo; cried Beecher, stopping, and opening wide his eyes in
astonishment. &ldquo;This <i>is</i> something new,&rdquo; muttered he. &ldquo;When did she
come?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Last night, sir, after dinner.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where from?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;From a Pensionnat outside the Porte de Scharbeck, I think, sir; at least,
her maid described it as in that direction.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what is she called,&mdash;Mademoiselle Violette, or Virginie, or Ida,
or what is it, eh?&rdquo; asked he, jocularly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mademoiselle, sir,&mdash;only Mademoiselle,&mdash;the Captain's
daughter!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;His daughter!&rdquo; repeated he, in increased wonderment, to himself. &ldquo;Can
this be possible?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is no doubt of it, sir. The lady of the Pensionnat brought her here
last night in her own carriage, and I heard her, as she entered the salon,
say, 'Now, Mademoiselle, that I have placed you in the hands of your
father&mdash;' and then the door closed.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I never knew he had a daughter,&rdquo; muttered Beecher to himself. &ldquo;Which is
my room?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We have prepared this one for you, but to-morrow you shall have a more
comfortable one, with a look-out over the lower town.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Put me somewhere where I sha'n't hear that confounded piano, I beg of
you. Who is it rattles away that fashion?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mademoiselle, sir.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure,&mdash;I ought to have guessed it; and sings too, I'll be
bound?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Like Grisi, sir,&rdquo; responded the waiter, enthusiastically; for the
Tirlemont, being frequented by the artistic class, had given him great
opportunity for forming his taste.
</p>
<p>
Just at this moment a rich, full voice swelled forth in one of the popular
airs of Verdi, but with a degree of ease and freedom that showed the
singer soared very far indeed above the pretensions of mere amateurship.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Wasn't I right, sir?&rdquo; asked the waiter, triumphantly. &ldquo;You'll not hear
anything better at the Grand Opera.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Send me up some hot water, and open that portmanteau,&rdquo; said Beecher,
while he walked on towards the door of the salon. He hesitated for a
second or two about then presenting himself; but as he thought of Grog
Davis, and what Grog Davis's daughter must be like, he turned the handle
and entered.
</p>
<p>
A lady rose from the piano as the door opened, and even in the
half-darkened room Beecher could perceive that she was graceful, and with
an elegance in her gesture for which he was in no wise prepared.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Have I the honor to address Miss Davis?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are Mr. Annesley Beecher, the gentleman my papa has been expecting,&rdquo;
 said she, with an easy smile. &ldquo;He has just gone off to meet you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Nothing could be more commonplace than these words, but they were uttered
in a way that at once declared the breeding of the speaker. She spoke to a
friend of her father, and there was a tone of one who felt that even in a
first meeting a certain amount of intimacy might subsist between them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's very strange,&rdquo; said Beecher, &ldquo;but your father and I have been
friends this many a year&mdash;close friends too&mdash;and I never as much
as suspected he had a daughter. What a shame of him not to have given me
the pleasure of knowing you before!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was a pleasure he was chary enough of to himself,&rdquo; said she, laughing.
&ldquo;I have been at school nearly four years, and have only seen him once, and
then for a few hours.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;but really,&rdquo; stammered out Beecher, &ldquo;fascinations&mdash;charms
such as&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pray, sir, don't distress yourself about turning a compliment. I'm quite
sure I'm very attractive, but I don't in the least want to be told so. You
see,&rdquo; she added, after a pause, &ldquo;I 'm presuming upon what papa has told me
of your old friendship to be very frank with you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am enchanted at it,&rdquo; cried Beecher. &ldquo;Egad! if you. 'cut out all the
work,' though, I 'll scarcely be able to follow you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah! so here you are before me,&rdquo; cried Davis, entering and shaking his
hand cordially. &ldquo;You had just driven off when I reached the station. All
right, I hope?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;All right, thank you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You 've made Lizzy's acquaintance, I see, so I need n't introduce you. <i>She</i>
knows you this many a day.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But why have I not had the happiness of knowing <i>her?</i>&rdquo; asked
Beecher.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How 's Klepper?&rdquo; asked Grog, abruptly. &ldquo;The swelling gone out of the
hocks yet?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; he's clean as a whistle.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The wind-gall, too,&mdash;has that gone?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Going rapidly; a few days' walking exercise will make him perfect.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No news of Spicer and his German friend,&mdash;though I expected to have
had a telegraph all day yesterday. But come, these are not interesting
matters for Lizzy,&mdash;we 'll have up dinner, and see about a box for
the opera.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A very gallant thought, papa, which I accept with pleasure.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I must dress, I suppose,&rdquo; said Beecher, half asking; for even yet he
could not satisfy his mind what amount of observance was due to the
daughter of Grog Davis.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I conclude you must,&rdquo; said she, smiling; &ldquo;and I too must make a suitable
toilette;&rdquo; and, with a slight bow and a little smile, she swept past them
out of the room.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How close you have been, old fellow,&mdash;close as wax,&mdash;about
this,&rdquo; said Beecher; &ldquo;and hang me, if she mightn't be daughter to the
proudest Duke in England!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So she might,&rdquo; said Grog; &ldquo;and it was to make her so, I have consented to
this life of separation. What respect and deference would the fellows show
<i>my</i> daughter when I wasn't by? How much delicacy would she meet with
when the fear of an ounce ball wasn't over them? And was I going to bring
her up in such a set as you and I live with? Was a young creature like
that to begin the world without seeing one man that wasn't a leg, or one
woman that wasn't worse? Was it by lessons of robbery and cheating her
mind was to be stored? And was she to start in life by thinking that a
hell was high society? Look at her <i>now</i>,&rdquo; said he, sternly, &ldquo;and say
if I was in Norfolk Island to-morrow, where 's the fellow that would have
the pluck to insult her? It is true <i>she</i> doesn't know me as you and
the others know me; but the man that would let her into <i>that</i> secret
would never tell her another.&rdquo; There was a terrible fierceness in his eye
as he spoke, and the words came from him with a hissing sound like the
venomous threatenings of a serpent. &ldquo;<i>She</i> knows nothing of <i>my</i>
life nor <i>my</i> ways. Except your own name, she never heard me mention
one of the fellows we live with. She knows <i>you</i> to be the brother of
Lord Viscount Lack-ington, and that you are the Honorable Annesley
Beecher, that's all she knows of <i>you</i>; ain't that little enough?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Beecher tried to laugh easily at this speech; but it was only a very poor
and faint attempt, after all.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;She thinks <i>me</i> a man of fortune, and <i>you</i> an unblemished
gentleman; and if that be not innocence, I 'd like to know what is! Of
where, how, and with whom we pick up our living, she knows as much as <i>we</i>
do about the Bench of Bishops.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I must confess I don't think the knowledge would improve her!&rdquo; said
Beecher, with a laugh.
</p>
<p>
A fierce and savage glance from Davis, however, very quickly arrested his
jocularity; and Beecher, in a graver tone, resumed: &ldquo;It was a deuced fine
thing of you, Grog, to do this. There 's not another fellow living would
have bad the head to think of it But now that she has come home to you,
how do you mean to carry on the campaign? A girl like that can't live
secluded from the world,&mdash;she must go out into society? Have you
thought of that?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have thought of it,&rdquo; rejoined Davis, bluntly, but in a tone that by no
means invited further inquiry.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Her style and her manner fit her for the best set anywhere&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's where I intend her to be,&rdquo; broke in Davis.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I need scarcely tell as clever a fellow as you,&rdquo; said Beecher, mildly,
&ldquo;that there's nothing so difficult as to find footing among these people.
Great wealth may obtain it, or great patronage. There are women in London
who can do that sort of thing; there are just two or three such, and you
may imagine how difficult it is to secure their favor.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They 're all cracked teacups, those women you speak of; one has only to
know where the flaw is, and see how easily managed they are!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Beecher smiled at this remark; he chuckled to himself, too, to see that
for once the wily Grog Davis had gone out of his depth, and adventured to
discuss people and habits of which he knew nothing; but, unwilling to
prolong a controversy so delicate, he hurried away to his room to dress.
Davis, too, retired on a similar errand, and a student of life might have
been amused to have taken a peep into the two dressing-rooms. As for
Beecher, it was but the work of a few minutes to array himself in dinner
costume. It was a routine task that he performed without a thought on its
details. All was ready at his hand; and even to the immaculate tie, which
seemed the work of patience and skill, he despatched the whole performance
in less than a quarter of an hour. Not so Davis: he ransacked drawers and
portmanteaus; covered the bed, the chairs, and the table with garments;
tried on and took off again; endeavored to make colors harmonize, or hit
upon happy contrasts. He was bent on appearing a &ldquo;swell;&rdquo; and,
unquestionably, when he did issue forth, with a canary-colored vest, and a
green coat with gilt buttons, his breast a galaxy of studs and festooned
chains, it would have been unfair to say he had not succeeded.
</p>
<p>
Beecher had but time to compliment him on his &ldquo;get up,&rdquo; when Miss Davis
entered. Though her dress was simply the quiet costume of a young
unmarried girl, there was in her carriage and bearing, as she came in, all
the graceful ease of the best society; and lighted up by the lamps of the
apartment, Beecher saw, to his astonishment, the most beautiful girl he
had ever beheld. It was not alone the faultless delicacy of her face, but
there was that mingled gentleness and pride, that strange blending of
softness and seriousness, which sit so well on the high-born, giving a
significance to every gesture or word of those whose every movement is so
measured, and every syllable so carefully uttered. &ldquo;Why was n't she a
countess in her own right?&rdquo; thought he; &ldquo;that girl might have all London
at her feet.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The dinner went on very pleasantly. Davis, too much occupied in listening
to his daughter or watching the astonishment of Beecher, scarcely ever
spoke; but the others chatted away about whatever' came uppermost in a
light and careless tone that delighted him.
</p>
<p>
Beecher was not sorry at the opportunity of a little dis-play. He was glad
to show Davis that in the great world of society he could play no
insignificant part; and so he put forth all his little talents as a
talker, with choice anecdotes of &ldquo;smart people,&rdquo; and the sayings and
doings of a set which, to Grog, were as much myths as the inscriptions on
an Assyrian monument. Lizzy Davis evidently took interest in his account
of London and its life. She liked, too, to hear about the families of her
schoolfellows, some of whom bore &ldquo;cognate&rdquo; names, and she listened with
actual eagerness to descriptions of the gorgeous splendor and display of a
town &ldquo;season.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And I am to see all these fine things, and know all these fine people,
papa?&rdquo; asked she.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so,&mdash;one of these days, at least,&rdquo; muttered Grog, not
caring to meet Beecher's eye.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don't think you care for this kind of life so much as Mr. Beecher, pa.
Is their frivolity too great for your philosophy?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It ain't that!&rdquo; muttered Grog, growing confused.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then do tell me, now, something of the sort of people you are fond of;
the chances are that I shall like them just as well as the others.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Beecher and Davis exchanged glances of most intense significance; and were
it not from downright fear, Beecher would have burst out laughing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then I will ask Mr. Beecher,&rdquo; said she, gayly. &ldquo;<i>You 'll</i> not be so
churlish as papa, I 'm certain. <i>You 'll</i> tell me what his world is
like?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, it's a very smart world too,&rdquo; said Beecher, slyly enjoying the
malicious moment of worrying Grog with impunity. &ldquo;Not so many pretty women
in it, perhaps, but plenty of movement, plenty of fun,&mdash;eh, Davis?
Are you fond of horses, Miss Davis?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Passionately; and I flatter myself I can ride too. By the way, is it
true, papa, you have brought a horse from England for me?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who could have told you that?&rdquo; said Davis, almost sternly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My maid heard it from a groom that has just arrived, but with such
secrecy that I suppose I have destroyed all the pleasure of the surprise
you intended me; never mind, dearest pa, I am just as grateful&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Grateful for nothing,&rdquo; broke in Davis. &ldquo;The groom is a prating rascal,
and your maid ought to mind her own affairs.&rdquo; Then reddening to his
temples with shame at his ill-temper, he added, &ldquo;There is a horse, to be
sure, but he ain't much of a lady's palfrey.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What would you say to her riding Klepper in the Allée Verte,&mdash;it
might be a rare stroke?&rdquo; asked Beecher, in a whisper to Davis.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you think that <i>she</i> is to be brought into <i>our</i> knaveries?
Is <i>that</i> all you have learned from what I 've been saying to you?&rdquo;
 whispered Davis, with a look of such savage ferocity that Beecher grew
sick at heart with terror.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'm sorry to break in upon such confidential converse,&rdquo; said she,
laughingly, &ldquo;but pray remember we are losing the first scene of the
opera.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'm at your orders,&rdquo; said Beecher, as, with his accustomed easy
gallantry, he stepped forward to offer her his arm.
</p>
<p>
The opera was a favorite one, and the house was crowded in every part. As
in all cities of a certain rank, the occupants of the boxes, with a few
rare exceptions, were the same well-known people who, night after night,
follow along the worn track of pleasure. To them the stage is but a
secondary object, to which attention only wanders at intervals. The house
itself, the brilliant blaze of beauty, the splendor of diamonds, the
display of dress, and, more than all these, the subtle by-play of
intrigue, detectable only by eyes deep-skilled and trained,&mdash;these
form the main attractions of a scene wherein our modern civilization is
more strikingly exhibited than in any other situation.
</p>
<p>
Scarcely had Lizzy Davis taken her seat than a low murmur of wondering
admiration ran through the whole house, and, in the freedom which our
present-day habits license, every opera-glass was turned towards her.
Totally unconscious of the admiration she was exciting, her glances ranged
freely over the theatre in every part, and her eyes were directed from
object to object in amazement at the gorgeousness of the scene around her.
Seated far back in the box, entirely screened from view, her father, too,
perceived nothing of that strange manifestation wherein a sort of homage
is blended with a degree of impertinence, but watched the stage with
intense eagerness. Very different from the feelings of either father or
daughter were the feelings of Annesley Beecher. He knew well the opera and
its habits, and as thoroughly saw that it is to the world of fashion what
Tattersall's or the turf is to the world of sport,&mdash;the great ring
where every match is booked, every engagement registered, and every new
aspirant for success canvassed and discussed. There was not a glance
turned towards the unconscious girl at his side but he could read its
secret import. How often had it been his own lot to stare up from his
stall at some fair face, unknown to that little world which arrogates to
itself all knowledge, and mingle his criticism with all the impertinences
fashion loves to indulge in! The steady stare of some, the unwilling
admiration of others, the ironical gaze of more, were all easy of
interpretation by him, and for the very first time in his life he became
aware of the fact that it was possible to be unjust with regard to the
unknown.
</p>
<p>
As the piece proceeded, and her interest in the play increased, a slightly
heightened color and an expression of half eagerness gave her beauty all
that it had wanted before of animation, and there was now an expression of
such captivation on her face that, carried away by that mysterious
sentiment which sways masses, sending its secret spell from heart to
heart, the whole audience turned from the scene to watch its varying
effects upon that beautiful countenance. The opera was &ldquo;Rigoletto,&rdquo; and
she continued to translate to her father the touching story of that sad
old man, who, lost to every sentiment of honor, still cherished in his
heart of hearts his daughter's love. The terrible contrast between his
mockery of the world and his affection for his home, the bitter
consciousness of how he treated others, conjuring up the terrors of what
yet might be his own fate, came to him in her words, as the stage revealed
their action, and gradually he leaned over in his eagerness till his head
projected outside the box.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There&mdash;was n't I right about her?&rdquo; said a voice from one of the
stalls beneath. &ldquo;That's Grog Davis. I know the fellow well.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 've won my wager,&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;There 's old Grog leaning over her
shoulder, and there can't be much doubt about her now.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Annesley Beecher at one side, and Grog Davis at the other,&rdquo; said a third,
make the case very easy reading. &ldquo;I 'll go round and get presented to
her.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let us leave this, Davis,&rdquo; whispered Beecher, while he trembled from head
to foot,&mdash;&ldquo;let us leave this at once. Come down to the crush-room,
and I 'll find a carriage.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
<a name="linkimage-0012" id="linkimage-0012">

</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
<img src="images/10342.jpg" width="100%" alt="342 " />
</div>
<p>
&ldquo;Why so&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo; said Davis; and as suddenly he followed
Beecher's glance towards the pit, whence every eye was turned towards
them.
</p>
<p>
That glance was not to be mistaken. It was the steady and insolent stare
the world bestows upon those who have neither champions nor defenders; and
Davis returned the gaze with a defiance as insulting.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;For any sake, Davis, let us get away,&rdquo; whispered Beecher again. &ldquo;Only
think of <i>her</i>, if there should be any exposure!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Exposure!&mdash;how should there? Who 'd dare&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Before he could finish, the curtain at the back of the box was rudely
drawn aside, and a tall, handsome man, with a certain swaggering ease of
manner that seemed to assert his right to be there if he pleased, came
forward, saying,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How goes it, Davis? I just caught a glimpse of that charming&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A word with you, Captain Hamilton,&rdquo; said Davis, between his teeth, as he
pushed the other towards the door.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;As many as you like, old fellow, by and by. For the present, I mean to
establish myself here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That you sha'n't, by Heaven!&rdquo; cried Davis, as he placed himself in front
of him. &ldquo;Leave this, sir, at once.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, the fellow is deranged,&rdquo; said Hamilton, laughing; &ldquo;or is it
jealousy, old boy?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
With a violent push Davis drove him backwards, and ere he could recover,
following up the impulse, he thrust him outside the box, hurriedly passing
outside, and shutting the door after him.
</p>
<p>
So rapidly and so secretly had all this occurred, that Lizzy saw nothing
of it, all her attention being eagerly fixed on the stage. Not so Beecher.
He had marked it all, and now sat listening in terror to the words of high
altercation in the lobby. From sounds that boded like insult and outrage,
the noise gradually decreased to more measured tones; then came a few
words in whisper, and Davis, softly drawing the curtain, stepped gently to
his chair at his daughter's back. A hasty sign to Beecher gave him to
understand that all was settled quietly, and the incident was over.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You 'll not think me very churlish if I rob you of one act of the opera,
Lizzy?&rdquo; said Davis, as the curtain fell; &ldquo;but I have a racking headache,
which all this light and heat are only increasing.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let us go at once, dearest papa,&rdquo; said she, rising. &ldquo;You should have told
me of this before. There, Mr. Beecher, you needn't leave this&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She's quite right,&rdquo; said Davis; &ldquo;you must remain.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And the words were uttered with a certain significance that Beecher well
understood as a command.
</p>
<p>
It was past midnight when Annesley Beecher returned to the hotel, and both
Davis and his daughter had already gone to their rooms.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Did your master leave any message for me?&rdquo; said he to the groom, who
acted as Davis's valet.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, sir, not a word.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you know, would he see me? Could you ask him?&rdquo; said he.
</p>
<p>
The man disappeared for a few minutes, and then coming back, said, &ldquo;Mr.
Davis is fast asleep, sir, and I dare not disturb him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said Beecher, and turned away.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How that fellow can go to bed and sleep, after such a business as that!&rdquo;
 muttered Beecher, as he drew his chair towards the fire, and sat
ruminating over the late incident. It was in a spirit of triumphant
satisfaction that he called to mind the one solitary point in which he was
the superior of Davis,&mdash;class and condition,&mdash;and he revelled in
the thought that men like Grog make nothing but blunders when they attempt
the habits of those above them. &ldquo;With all his shrewdness,&rdquo; said he to
himself, half aloud, &ldquo;he could not perceive that he has been trying an
impossibility. She is beyond them all in beauty, her manners are perfect,
her breeding unexceptionable; and yet, there she is, Grog Davis's
daughter! Ay, Grog, my boy, you 'll see it one of these days. It 's all to
no use. Enter her for what stakes you like, she 'll be always
disqualified. There 's only one thing carries these attempts through,&mdash;if
you could give her a pot of money. Yes, Master Davis, there are fellows&mdash;and
with good blood in their veins&mdash;that, for fifty or sixty thousand
pounds, would marry even <i>your</i> daughter.&rdquo; With this last remark he
finished all his reflections, and proceeded to prepare for bed.
</p>
<p>
Sleep, however, would not come; he was restless and uneasy; the incident
in the theatre might get abroad, and his own name be mentioned; or it
might be that Hamilton, knowing well who and what Davis was, would look to
him, Beecher, for satisfaction. There was another pleasant eventuality,&mdash;to
be drawn into a quarrel and shot for Grog Davis's daughter! To be the
travelling-companion of such a man was bad enough; to risk being seen with
him on railroads and steamboats was surely sufficient; but to be paraded
in places of public amusement, to be dragged before the well-dressed
world, not as his chance associate, but as a member of his domestic
circle, chaperoning his daughter to the opera, was downright intolerable!
And thus was it that this man, who had been dunned and insulted by
creditors, hunted from place to place by sheriff's officers, browbeaten by
bankruptcy practitioners, stigmatized by the press, haunted all the while
by a conscience that whispered there was even worse hanging over him, yet
did he feel more real terror from the thought of how he would be regarded
by his own &ldquo;order&rdquo; for this unseemly intimacy, than shame for all his
deeper and graver transgressions.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, at last, springing from his bed, and lighting his candle,
&ldquo;I 'll be off. I 'll cut my lucky, Master Grog; and here goes to write you
half a dozen lines to break the fact to you. I 'll call it a sudden
thought&mdash;a notion&mdash;that I ought to see Lackington at once. I 'll
say that I could n't think of subjecting Miss Davis to the inconvenience
of that rapid mode of travelling I feel to be so imminently necessary. I
'll tell him that as I left the theatre, I saw one of Fordyce's clerks,
that the fellow knew me and grinned, and that I know I shall be arrested
if I stay here. I 'll hint that Hamilton, who is highly connected, will
have the English Legation at us all. Confound it, he 'll believe none of
these. I 'll just say&rdquo;&mdash;Here he took his pen and wrote,&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Dear D.,&mdash;After we parted last night, a sudden caprice
seized me that I 'd start off at once for Italy. Had you
been alone, old fellow, I should never have thought of it;
but seeing that I left you in such charming company, with
one whose&mdash;['No, that won't do&mdash;I must strike out that;
and so he murmured over the lines ending in 'company.' and
then went on.]&mdash;I have no misgivings about being either
missed or wanted.&mdash;['Better, perhaps, missed or
regretted.'] We have been too long friends to&mdash;['No, we
are too old pals, that's better&mdash;he does n't care much for
friendship']&mdash;too old pals to make me suspect you will be
displeased with this&mdash;this unforeseen&mdash;['That's a
capital word!&mdash;unforeseen what? It's always calamity
comes after  unforeseen; but I can't call it calamity']&mdash;
unforeseen 'bolt over the ropes,' and believe me as ever, or
believe me 'close as wax,'

&ldquo;Yours,  A. B.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
&ldquo;A regular diplomatic touch, I call that note,&rdquo; said he, as he reread it
to himself with much complacency. &ldquo;Lack-ington thinks me a 'flat;' then
let any one read that, and say if the fellow that wrote it is a fool.&rdquo; And
now he sealed and directed his epistle, having very nearly addressed it to
Grog, instead of to Captain Davis. &ldquo;His temper won't be angelic when he
gets it,&rdquo; muttered he, &ldquo;but I'll be close to Liege by that time.&rdquo; And with
this very reassuring reflection he jumped into bed again, determining to
remain awake till daybreak.
</p>
<p>
Wearied out at last with watching, Annesley Beecher fell off asleep, and
so soundly, too, that it was not till twice spoken to he could arouse and
awaken.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Eh, what is it, Rivers?&rdquo; cried he, as he saw the trim training-groom at
his side. &ldquo;Anything wrong with the horse?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, sir, nothing; <i>he's</i> all right, anyhow.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What is it, then; any one from town looking for us?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, sir, nobody whatever. It's the Captain himself&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What of him? Is he ill?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sound as a roach, sir; he's many a mile off by this. Says he to me,
'Rivers,' says he, 'when you gets back to the Tirlemont, give this note to
Mr. Beecher; he 'll tell you afterwards what's to be done. Only,' says he,
'don't forget to rub a little of the white oils on that near hock; very
weak,' says he; 'be sure it's very weak, so as not to blister him.' Ain't
he a wonderful man, sir, to be thinking o' that at such a moment?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Draw the curtain, there,&mdash;let me have more light,&rdquo; cried Beecher,
eagerly, as he opened the small and crumpled piece of paper. The contents
were in pencil, and very brief,&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;I 'm off through the Ardennes towards Treves; come up to
Aix with my daughter, and wait there till you hear from me.
There 's a vacant 'troop' in the Horse Guards Blue this
morning. Rivers can tell you all.&mdash;Yours, C. D.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
&ldquo;What has happened, Rivers?&rdquo; cried he, in intense anxiety. &ldquo;Tell me at
once.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sir, it don't take long to tell. It did n't take very long to do. It was
three, or maybe half-past, this morning, the Captain comes to my room, and
says, 'Rivers, get up; be lively,' says he, 'dress yourself, and go over
to Jonesse, that fellow as has the shooting-gallery, give him this note;
he 'll just read it, and answer it at once; then run over to Burton's and
order a coupé, with two smart horses, to be here at five; after that come
back quickly, for I want a few things packed up.' He made a sign to me
that all was to be 'dark,' and so away I went, and before three quarters
of an hour was back here again. At five to the minute the carriage came to
the corner of the park, and we stepped out quietly; and when we reached
it, there was Jonesse inside, with a tidy little box on his knee. 'Oh, is
that it?' said I, for I knowed what that box meant,&mdash;'is that it?'
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;'Yes,' says the Captain, 'that's it; get up and make him drive briskly to
Boitsfort.' We were a bit late, I think, for the others was there when we
got up, and I heard them grumbling something about being behind time.
'Egad,' says the Captain, 'you 'll find we 've come early enough before
we've done with you.' They were cruel words, sir, now that I think how he
tumbled him over stone dead in a moment.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who dead?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That fine, handsome young man, with the light-brown beard,&mdash;Hamilton,
they said his name was,&mdash;and a nicer fellow you could n't wish to
see. I 'll never forget him as he lay there stretched on the grass, and
the small blue hole in his forehead,&mdash;you 'd not believe it was ever
half the size of a bullet,&mdash;and his glove in his left hand, all so
natural as if he was alive. I believe I 'd have been standing there yet,
looking at him, when the Captain called me, and said, 'Rivers, take these
stirrups up a hole,'&mdash;for he had a saddle-horse all ready for him,&mdash;'and
give this note to Mr. Beecher; he 'll give you his orders about Klepper,'
says he, 'but mind you look to that hock.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And Captain Hamilton was killed?&rdquo; muttered Beecher, while he trembled
from head to foot at the terrible tidings.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Killed&mdash;dead&mdash;he never moved a finger after he fell!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What did his friend do? Did he say anything?&mdash;did he speak?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He dropped down on his knees beside him, and caught him by the hand, and
cried out, 'George, my own dear fellow,&mdash;George, speak to me;' but
George never spoke another word.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And Davis,&mdash;Captain Davis,&mdash;what did he do?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He shook hands with Jones, and said something in French that made him
laugh; and then going over to where the body lay, he said, 'Colonel
Humphrey,' says he, 'you 're a witness that all was fair and honorable,
and that if this unhappy affair ever comes to be&mdash;' and then the
Colonel moved his hand for him to be off, and not speak to him. And so the
Captain took his advice, and got into the saddle; but I heard him mutter
something about 'teaching the Colonel better manners next time they met.&rdquo;
 </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">

</div>
<p>
&ldquo;And then he rode away?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; he turned into the wood, at a walking pace, for he was lighting his
cigar. I saw no more of him, after that, for they called me to help them
with the body, and it was all we could do, four of us, to carry him to the
road where the carriage was standing.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Did you ever hear them mention my name amongst them?&rdquo; asked Beecher,
tremblingly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, sir; nobody spoke of you but my master, when he handed me the note.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What a sad business it has all been!&rdquo; exclaimed Beecher, half aloud.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I suppose it would go hard with the Captain, sir, if he was caught?&rdquo; said
Rivers, inquiringly.
</p>
<p>
Again Beecher read over the note, pondering every word as he went &ldquo;What a
sad business!&rdquo; murmured he, &ldquo;and all for nothing, or next to nothing!&rdquo;
 Then, as if suddenly rousing himself to action, he said, &ldquo;Rivers, we must
get away at once. Take this passport to the police, and then look after a
horse-box for the next train to Liege. We shall start at two o'clock.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's just what the Captain said, sir. 'Don't delay in Brussels,' says
he; 'and don't you go a-talking about this morning's work. If they have
you up for examination, mind that you saw nothing, you heard nothing, you
know nothing.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Send Miss Davis's maid here,&rdquo; said Beecher; &ldquo;and then see about those
things I 've mentioned to you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mademoiselle Annette was a French Swiss, who very soon apprehended that a
&ldquo;difficulty&rdquo; had occurred somewhere, which was to be kept secret from her
young mistress; and though she smiled with a peculiar significance at the
notion of Miss Davis travelling under Beecher's protection, she did so
with all the decorum of her gifted class.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You 'll explain everything, Annette,&rdquo; said Beecher, who in his confusion
was eager to throw any amount of burden or responsibility upon another;
&ldquo;you'll tell her whatever you like as to the cause of his going away, and
I 'll swear to it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Monsieur need not give himself any trouble,&rdquo; was the ready answer; &ldquo;all
shall be cared for.&rdquo;
 </p>

<h2>
CHAPTER XXXI. EXPLANATIONS.
</h2>
<p>
What a sad pity it is that the great faculty of &ldquo;making things
comfortable,&rdquo; that gifted power which blends the announcement with the
explanation of misfortune, should be almost limited to that narrow guild
in life to which Mademoiselle Annette belonged! The happy knack of
half-informing and all-mystifying would be invaluable on the Treasury
benches; and great proficients as some of our public men are in this walk,
how immeasurably do they fall short of the dexterity of the &ldquo;soubrette&rdquo;!
</p>
<p>
So neatly and so cleverly had Annette performed her task, that when Miss
Davis met Beecher at breakfast, she felt that a species of reserve was
necessary as to the reasons of her father's flight; that, as he had not
directly communicated with herself, her duty was simply to accept of the
guidance he had dictated to her. Besides this, let it be owned, she had
not yet rallied from the overwhelming astonishment of her first meeting
with her father, so utterly was he unlike all that her imagination had
pictured him! Nothing could be more affectionate, nothing kinder, than his
reception; a thoughtful anxiety for her comfort pervaded all he said. The
gloomy old Tirlemont even caught up an air of home as she passed the
threshold; but still he was neither in look, manner, nor appearance what
she fancied. All his self-restraint could not gloss over his vulgarity,
nor all his reserve conceal his defects in breeding. His short,
dictatorial manner with the servants,&mdash;his ever-present readiness to
confront nobody saw what peril,&mdash;a suspectful insistence upon this or
that mark of deference as a right of which he might possibly be defrauded,&mdash;all
gave to his bearing a tone of insolent defiance that at once terrified and
repelled her.
</p>
<p>
To all her eager questionings as to their future life, where and how it
was to be passed, he would only answer vaguely or evasively. He met her
inquiries about the families and friends of her schoolfellows in the same
way. Of her pleasures and pursuits, her love of music, and her skill in
drawing, he could not even speak with those conventionalities that
disguise ignorance or indifference. Of the great world&mdash;the &ldquo;swells&rdquo;
 he would have called them&mdash;he only knew such as were on the turf. Of
the opera, he might possibly tell the price of a stall, but not the name
of a singer; and as to his own future, what or where it should be, Grog no
more knew than who would be first favorite for the Léger a century hence.
To &ldquo;fence off&rdquo; any attempt &ldquo;to pump him&rdquo; in the ring, to dodge a clever
cross-examiner in a court of justice, Davis would have proved himself
second to none,&mdash;these were games of skill, which he could play with
the best,&mdash;but it was a very different task to thread his way through
the geography of a land he had not so much as heard of, and be asked to
act as guide through regions whose very names were new to him.
</p>
<p>
The utmost that Lizzy could glean from that long first evening's talk was,
that her father had few or no political ambitions, rather shunned the
great world, cared little for dukes or duchesses, nor set any great store
on mere intellectual successes. &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;he has tried and
found the hollowness of them all; perhaps he is weary of public life;
perhaps he 'd like the quiet pleasures of a country house, and that calm
existence described as the chateau life of England. Would that he were
only more frank with me, and let us know each other better!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
We entreat our readers to forgive us this digression, necessary as it is
to show that Lizzy, whatever her real doubts and anxieties, felt bound not
to display them, but accept Beecher's counsel as her father's will.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And so we start for Aix-la-Chapelle by two?&rdquo; said she, calmly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; and I represent papa,&rdquo; said Beecher. &ldquo;I hope you feel impressed with
a due reverence for my authority.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Much will depend upon the way you exercise it,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I could very
easily be a rebel if I suspected the justice of the Crown.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said he, laughing, &ldquo;don't threaten me! my viceroyship will
be very short-lived,&mdash;he 'll perhaps be at Aix before us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And I suppose all my dreams of extravagance here are defeated,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;Annette and I have been plotting and planning such rare devices in
'toilette,' not exactly aware where or upon whom the captivations were to
be exercised. I actually revelled in the thought of all the smart fineries
my Pensionnat life has denied me hitherto.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
There was that blending of levity with seriousness in her tone that
totally puzzled Beecher; and so was it through all she said,&mdash;there
ran the same half-mocking vein that left him quite unable even to fathom
her meaning. He muttered out something about &ldquo;dress&rdquo; and &ldquo;smart things&rdquo;
 being to be found everywhere, and that most probably they should visit
even more pretentious cities than Brussels erelong.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Which means that you know perfectly well where we are going, but won't
tell it. Well, I resign myself to my interesting part of 'Captive
Princess' all the more submissively, since every place is new to me, every
town an object of interest, every village a surprise.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You 'd like to see the world,&mdash;the real, the great world, I mean?&rdquo;
 asked Beecher.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, how much!&rdquo; cried she, clasping her hands in eagerness, as she arose.
</p>
<p>
Beecher watched her as she walked up and down the room, every movement of
her graceful figure displaying dignity and pride, her small and
beautifully shaped head slightly thrown back, while, as her hand held the
folds of her dress, her march had something almost stage-like in its
sweeping haughtiness. &ldquo;And how she would become it!&rdquo; muttered he, below
his breath, but yet leaving the murmured sounds half audible.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What are you saying, sir? Any disparaging sentiment on school-girl
conceit or curiosity?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Something very like the opposite,&rdquo; said Beecher. &ldquo;I was whispering to
myself that Grantley House and Rocksley Castle were the proper sphere for
<i>you</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are these very splendid?&rdquo; asked she, calmly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The best houses in England. Of their owners, one is a Duke with two
hundred thousand a year, the other an Earl with nearly as much.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what do they do with it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Everything; all that money can have&mdash;and what is there it cannot?&mdash;is
there. Gorgeous houses, horses, dress, dinners, pictures, plate, the best
people to visit them, the best cook, the best deer-park, the fastest yacht
at Cowes, the best hunting-stable at Melton.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I should like that; it sounds very fascinating, all of it. How it
submerges at once, too, all the petty cares and contrivances, perpetually
asking, 'Can we do this?' 'Dare we do that?' It makes existence the grand,
bold, free thing one dreams it ought to be.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You 're right there; it does make life very jolly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are <i>you</i> very rich?&rdquo; asked she, abruptly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, by Jove! poor as a church mouse,&rdquo; said he, laughing at the
strangeness of the question, whose sincere simplicity excluded all notion
of impertinence. &ldquo;I'm what they call a younger son, which means one who
arrives in the world when the feast is over. I have a brother with a very
tidy fortune, if that were of any use to me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And is it not the same? You share your goods together, I suppose?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I should be charmed to share mine with him, on terms of reciprocity,&rdquo;
 said Beecher; &ldquo;but I 'm afraid he 'd not like it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So that he is rich, and you poor?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Exactly so.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And this is called brotherhood? I own I don't understand it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, it has often puzzled me too,&rdquo; said Beecher, laughingly; &ldquo;but I
believe, if I had been born first, I should have had no difficulty in it
whatever.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And papa?&rdquo; asked she, suddenly,&mdash;&ldquo;what was he,&mdash;an elder or a
younger son?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It was all that Beecher could do to maintain a decent gravity at this
question. To be asked about Grog Davis's parentage seemed about the
drollest of all possible subjects of inquiry; but, with an immense effort
of self-restraint, he said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I never exactly knew; I rather suspect, however, he was an only child.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then there is no title in our family?&rdquo; said she, inquiringly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I believe not; but you are aware that this is very largely the case in
England. We are not all 'marquises' and 'counts' and 'chevaliers,' like
foreigners.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I like a title; I like its distinctiveness: the sense of carrying out a
destiny, transmitting certain traits of race and kindred, seems a fine and
ennobling thing; and this one has not, one cannot have, who has no past.
So that,&rdquo; said she, after a pause, &ldquo;papa is only what you would call a
'gentleman.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;'Gentleman' is a very proud designation, believe me,&rdquo; said he, evading an
answer.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And how would they address me in England,&mdash;am I 'my Lady'?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, you are Miss Davis.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How meanly it sounds,&mdash;it might be a governess, a maid.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;When you are married, you take the rank and title of your husband,&mdash;a
duchess, if he be a duke.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A duchess be it, then,&rdquo; said she, in that light, volatile tone she was
ever best pleased to employ, while, with a rattling gayety, she went on:
&ldquo;How I should love to be one of those great people you have described to
me,&mdash;soaring away in all that ideal splendor which would come of a
life of boundless cost, the actual and the present being only suggestive
of a thousand fancied enjoyments! What glorious visions might one conjure
up out of the sportiveness of an untrammelled will! Yes, Mr. Beecher, I
have made up my mind,&mdash;I 'll be a duchess!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But you might have all these as a marchioness, a countess&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, I 'll be a duchess; you sha'n't cheat me out of my just claims.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Will your Grace please to give orders about packing up, for we must be
away soon after one o'clock,&rdquo; said he, laughing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If I were not humility itself, I'd say the train should await my
convenience,&rdquo; said she, as she left the room with a proud and graceful
dignity that would have become a queen.
</p>
<p>
For a few moments Beecher sat silent and thoughtful in his chair, and then
burst out into a fit of immoderate laughing,&mdash;he laughed till his
eyes ran over and his sides ached. &ldquo;If this ain't going the pace, I 'd
like to know what speed is!&rdquo; cried he, aloud. &ldquo;I wonder what old Grog
would say if he heard her; and the best of the joke is, she is serious all
the while. She is in the most perfect good faith about it all. And this
comes of the absurdity of educating her out of her class. What a strange
blunder for so clever a head to make! You might have guessed, Master Grog,
that she never could be a 'plater.' Let her only enter for a grand match,
and she 'll be 'scratched' from one end of England to the other. Ay,
Davis, my boy, you fancy pedigrees are only cared for on the turf; but
there <i>is</i> a Racing Calendar, edited by a certain Debrett, that you
never heard of.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Again, he thought of Davis as a peer,&mdash;&ldquo;Viscount Davis!&rdquo; Baron Grog,
as he muttered it, came across him, and he burst out once more into
laughter; then suddenly checking himself, he said, &ldquo;I must take right good
care, though, that he never hears of this same conversation; he's just the
fellow to say <i>I</i> led her on to laugh at and ridicule him; he 'd
suspect in a moment that I took her that pleasant gallop,&mdash;and if he
did&mdash;&rdquo; A long, wailing whistle finished the sentence for him.
</p>
<p>
Other and not very agreeable reflections succeeded these. It was this very
morning that he himself had determined on &ldquo;levanting,&rdquo; and there he was,
more securely moored than ever. He looked at his watch, and muttered,
&ldquo;Eleven o'clock; by this time I should have been at Verviers, and on the
Rhine before midnight. In four days more, I 'd have had the Alps between
us, and now here I am without the chance of escape; for if I bolted and
left his daughter here, he'd follow me through the world to shoot me!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He sat silent for some minutes, and then, suddenly springing up from his
chair, he cried out,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Precious hard luck it is! but I can neither get on <i>with</i> this
fellow nor <i>without</i> him;&rdquo; and with this &ldquo;summing up&rdquo; he went off to
his room to finish his preparations for the road.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXXII. THE COUPÉ ON THE RAIL.
</h2>
<p>
Annesley Beecher felt it &ldquo;deuced odd&rdquo; to be the travelling companion and
protector of a very beautiful girl of nineteen, to whose fresh youth every
common object of the road was a thing of wonderment and curiosity; the
country, the people, the scores of passengers arriving or departing, the
chance incidents of the way all amused her. She possessed that power of
deriving intense enjoyment from the mere aspect of life that characterizes
certain minds, and while thus each little incident interested her, her gay
and lively sallies animated one who without her companionship had smoked
his cigar in half-sulky isolation, voting journey and fellow-travellers
&ldquo;most monstrous bores.&rdquo; As they traversed that picturesque tract between
Chaude Fontaine and Verviers, her delight and enjoyment increased. Those
wonderful little landscapes which open at the exit from each tunnel, and
where to the darkness and the gloom succeed, as if by magic, those rapid
glances at swelling lawns, deep-bosomed woods, and winding rivers, with
peaceful homesteads dotting the banks, were so many surprises full of
marvellous beauty.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah! Mr. Beecher,&rdquo; said she, as they emerged upon one of these charming
spots, &ldquo;I'm half relenting about my decision in regard to greatness. I
think that in those lovely valleys yonder, where the tall willows are
hanging over the river, there might possibly be an existence I should like
better than the life of even a duchess.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's a much easier ambition to gratify,&rdquo; said he, smiling.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was not of <i>that</i> I was thinking,&rdquo; said she, haughtily, &ldquo;nor am I
so certain you are right there. I take it people can generally be that
they have set their heart on being.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I should like to be convinced of your theory,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;for I have been
I can't say how many years wishing for fifty things I have never succeeded
in attaining.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What else have you done besides wishing?&rdquo; asked she, abruptly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, that is a hard question,&rdquo; said he, in some confusion; &ldquo;and after
all, I don't see what remained to me to do but wish.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If that were all, it is pretty clear you had no right to succeed. When I
said that people can have what they set their heart on, I meant what they
so longed for that no toil was too great, no sacrifice too painful to
deter them; that with eyes upturned to the summit they could breast the
mountain, not minding weariness, and even when, footsore and exhausted,
they sank down, they arose to the same enterprise, unshaken in courage,
unbroken in faith. Have you known this?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I can scarcely say I have; but as to the longing and pining after a good
turn of fortune, I'll back myself against any one going.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's the old story of the child crying for the moon,&rdquo; said she,
laughing. &ldquo;Now, what was it you longed for so ardently?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Can't you guess?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You wanted to marry some one who would not have you, or who was beneath
you, or too poor, or too some-thing-or-other for your grand relations?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, not that.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You aspired to some great distinction as a politician, or a soldier, or
perhaps a sailor?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, by Jove! never dreamed of it,&rdquo; burst he in, laughing at the very
idea.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You sighed for some advancement in rank, or perhaps it was great wealth?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There you have it! Plenty of money&mdash;lots of ready&mdash;with that
all the rest comes easy.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It must be very delightful, no doubt, to indulge every passing caprice,
without ever counting the cost; but, after a while, what a spoilt-child
weariness would come over one from all this cloying enjoyment,&mdash;how
tiresome would it be to shorten the journey between will and
accomplishment, and make of life a mere succession of 'tableaux'! I 'd
rather strive and struggle and win.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ay, but one does n't always win,&rdquo; broke he in.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I believe one does&mdash;if one deserves it; and even when one does not,
the battle is a fine thing. How much sympathy, I ask you, have we for
those classic heroes who are always helped out of their difficulties by
some friendly deity? What do we feel for him who, in the thick of the
fight, is sure to be rescued by a goddess in a cloud?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I confess I do like a good 'book,' 'hedged' well all round, and standing
to win somewhere. I mean,&rdquo; added he, in an explanatory tone, &ldquo;I like to be
safe in this world.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stand on the bank of the stream, then, and let bolder hearts push across
the river!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, but I 'm rather out of patience,&rdquo; said he, in a tone of half
irritation. &ldquo;I 've had many a venture in life, and too many of them
unfortunate ones.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How I do wonder,&rdquo; said she, after a pause, &ldquo;that you and papa are such
great friends; for I have rarely heard of two people who take such widely
different notions of life. <i>You</i> seem to me all caution and reserve;
<i>he</i>, all daring and energy.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's the reason, perhaps, we suit each other so well,&rdquo; said Beecher,
laughing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; said she, thoughtfully; and now there was silence between
them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Have you got sisters, Mr. Beecher?&rdquo; said she, at length.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No; except I may call my brother's wife one.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Tell me of her. Is she young?&mdash;is she handsome?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She is not young, but she is still a very handsome woman.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Dark or fair?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very dark, almost Spanish in complexion; a great deal of haughtiness in
her look, but great courtesy when she pleases.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Would she like me?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course she would,&rdquo; said he, with a smile and a bow; but a flush
covered his face at the bare thought of their meeting.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'm not so certain you are telling the truth there,&rdquo; said she, laughing;
&ldquo;and yet you know there can be no offence in telling me I should not suit
some one I have never seen; do, then, be frank with me, and say what would
she think of me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To begin,&rdquo; said he, laughing, &ldquo;she 'd say you were very beautiful&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;'Exquisitely beautiful,' was the phrase of that old gentleman that got
into the next carriage; and I like it better.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, exquisitely beautiful,&mdash;the perfection of gracefulness,&mdash;and
highly accomplished.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She'd not say any such thing; she'd not describe me like a governess; she
'd probably say I was too demonstrative,&mdash;that's a phrase in vogue
just now,&mdash;and hint that I was a little vulgar. But I assure you,&rdquo;
 added she, seriously, &ldquo;I'm not so when I speak French. It is a stupid
attempt on my part to catch up what I imagine must be English frankness
when I talk the language that betrays me into all these outspoken
extravagances. Let us talk French now.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You 'll have the conversation very nearly to yourself then,&rdquo; said
Beecher, &ldquo;for I'm a most indifferent linguist.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, then, I must ask you to take my word for it, and believe that I 'm
well bred when I can afford it. But your sister,&mdash;do tell me of her.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She is 'très grande dame,' as you would call it,&rdquo; said Beecher; &ldquo;very
quiet, very cold, extremely simple in language, dresses splendidly, and
never knows wrong people.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who are wrong people?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don't exactly know how to define them; but they are such as are to be
met with in society, not by claim of birth and standing, but because they
are very rich, or very clever, in some way or other,&mdash;people, in
fact, that one has to ask who they are.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I understand. But that must apply to a pretty wide circle of this world's
habitants.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So it does. A great part of Europe, and <i>all</i> America,&rdquo; said
Beecher, laughing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And papa and myself, how should we come through this formidable inquiry?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, hesitating, &ldquo;your father has always lived so much out of
the world,&mdash;this kind of world, I mean,&mdash;so studiously retired,
that the chances are that, in short&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;In short, they 'd ask, 'Who are these Davises?'&rdquo; She threw into her face,
as she spoke, such an admirable mimicry of proud pretension that Beecher
laughed immoderately at it &ldquo;And when they 'd ask it,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;I 'd
be very grateful to you to tell me what to reply to them, since I own to
you it is a most puzzling question to myself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Beecher, in some embarrassment, &ldquo;it is strange enough; but
though your father and I are very old friends,&mdash;as intimate as men
can possibly be,&mdash;yet he has never spoken to me about his family or
connections,&mdash;nay, so far has he carried his reserve, that, until
yesterday, I was not aware he had a daughter.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You don't mean to say he never spoke of me?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Never to <i>me</i>, at least; and, as I have told you, I believe no one
possesses a larger share of his confidence than myself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That <i>was</i> strange,&rdquo; said she, in deep reflection. Then, after a few
minutes, she resumed: &ldquo;If I had a story of my life I 'd tell it you; but
there is really none, or next to none. As a child, I was at school in
Cornwall. Later on, papa came and fetched me away to a small cottage near
Walmer, where I lived with a sort of governess, who treated me with great
deference,&mdash;in short, observed towards me so much respect that I grew
to believe I was something very exalted and distinguished, a sort of 'Man
in the Iron Mask,' whose pretensions had only to be known to convulse half
Europe. Thence I passed over to the Pensionnat at the Three Fountains,
where I found, if not the same homage, all the indications of my being
regarded as a privileged individual. I had my maid; I enjoyed innumerable
little indulgences none others possessed. I 'm not sure whether the pony I
rode at the riding-school was my own or not; I only know that none mounted
him but myself. In fact, I was treated like one apart, and all papa's
letters only reiterated the same order,&mdash;I was to want for nothing.
Of course, these teachings could impress but one lesson,&mdash;that I was
a person of high rank and great fortune; and of this I never entertained a
doubt. Now,&rdquo; added she, with more energy, &ldquo;so far as I understand its
uses, I <i>do</i> like wealth, and so far as I can fancy its privileges, I
love rank; but if the tidings came suddenly upon me that I had neither one
nor the other, I feel a sort of self-confidence that tells me I should not
be dispirited or discouraged.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Beecher gazed at her with such admiration that a deep blush rose to her
face, as she said, &ldquo;You may put this heroism of mine to the test at once,
by telling me frankly what you know about my station. Am I a Princess in
disguise, Mr. Beecher, or am I only an item in the terrible category of
what you have just called 'wrong people'?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
If the dread and terror of Grog Davis had been removed from Annesley
Beecher's mind, there is no saying to what excess of confidence the
impulse of the moment might have carried him. He was capable of telling
her any and every thing. For a few seconds, indeed, the thought of being
her trusted friend so overcame his prudence that he actually took her hand
between his own, as the prelude of the revelations he was about to open;
when, suddenly, a vision of Davis swept before his mind,&mdash;Davis, in
one of his moods of wrath, paroxysms of passion as they were, wherein he
stopped at nothing. &ldquo;He 'd send me to the dock as a felon; he 'd shoot me
down like a dog,&rdquo; muttered he to himself, as, dropping her hand, he leaned
back in the carriage.
</p>
<p>
She bent over and looked calmly into his face. Her own was now perfectly
pale and colorless, and then, with a faint, sad smile, she said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I see that you 'd like to gratify me. It is through some sense of
delicacy and reserve that you hesitate. Be it so. Let us be good friends
now, and perhaps, in time, we may trust each other thoroughly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Beecher took her hand once more, and, bending down, kissed it fervently.
What a strange thrill was that that ran through his heart, and what an odd
sense of desolation was it as he relinquished that fair, soft hand, as
though it were that by its grasp he held on to life and hope together!
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; muttered he to himself, &ldquo;why was not she&mdash;why was not he
himself&mdash;twenty things that neither of them were?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wish I could read your thoughts,&rdquo; said she, smiling gently at him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wish to heaven you could!&rdquo; cried he, with an honest energy that his
nature had not known for many a day.
</p>
<p>
For the remainder of the way neither spoke, beyond some chance remark upon
the country or the people. It was as though the bridge between them was
yet too frail to cross, and that they trusted to time to establish that
interchange of thought and confidence which each longed for.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here we are at the end of our journey!&rdquo; said he, with a sigh, as they
entered Aix.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And the beginning of our friendship,&rdquo; said she, with a smile, while she
held out her hand to pledge the contract.
</p>
<p>
So intently was Beecher gazing at her face that he did not notice the
action.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Won't you have it?&rdquo; asked she, laughing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Which,&rdquo; cried he,&mdash;&ldquo;the hand or the friendship?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I meant the friendship,&rdquo; said she, quietly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Tickets, sir!&rdquo; said the guard, entering. &ldquo;We are at the station.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Annesley Beecher was soon immersed in all those bustling cares which
attend the close of a journey; and though Lizzy seemed to enjoy the
confusion and turmoil that prevailed, he was far from happy amidst the
anxieties about baggage and horse-boxes, the maid and the groom each
tormenting him in the interests of their several departments. All was,
however, safe; not a cap-case was missing; Klepper &ldquo;never lost a hair;&rdquo;
 and they drove off to the Hotel of the Four Nations in high spirits all.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXXIII. THE &ldquo;FOUR NATIONS&rdquo; AT AIX
</h2>
<p>
All the bustle of &ldquo;settling down&rdquo; in the hotel over, Annesley Beecher
began to reflect a little on the singularity of his situation. The
wondering admiration which had followed Lizzy Davis wherever she appeared
on the journey seemed to have reached its climax now, and little knots and
groups of lounging travellers were to be seen before the windows, curious
to catch a glance at this surpassing beauty. Now, had she been his <i>bona
fide</i> property, he was just the man to derive the most intense
enjoyment from this homage at second hand; he 'd have exulted and
triumphed in it. His position was, however, a very different one, and, as
merely her companion, while it exposed her to very depreciating judgments,
it also necessitated on his part a degree of haughty defiance and
championship for which he had not the slightest fancy whatever.
</p>
<p>
Annesley Beecher dragged into a row for Grog Davis's daughter, Beecher
fighting some confounded Count or other about Lizzy Davis, Annesley shot
by some Zouave Captain who insisted on waltzing with his &ldquo;friend,&rdquo;&mdash;these
were pleasant mind-pictures which he contemplated with the very reverse of
enjoyment; and yet the question of her father's station away, he felt it
was a cause wherein even one who had no more love for the &ldquo;duello&rdquo; than
himself might well have perilled life. All her loveliness and grace had
not been wasted when they could kindle up a little gleam of chivalry in
the embers of that wasted heart!
</p>
<p>
He ran over in his mind all the Lady Julias and Georginasof the
fashionable world. He bethought him of each of those who had been the
queens of London seasons, and yet how vastly were they all her inferiors!
It was not alone that in beauty she eclipsed them, but she possessed,
besides, the thousand nameless attractions of manner and gesture, a
certain blended dignity and youthful gayety that made her seem the very
ideal of high-born loveliness. He had seen dukes' daughters who could not
vie with her in these gifts; he had known countesses immeasurably beneath
her. From these thoughts he went on to others as to her future, and the
kind of fellow that might marry her; for, strangely enough, in all his
homage there mingled the ever-present memory of Grog and his pursuits.
Mountjoy Stubbs might marry her; he has fifty thousand a year, and his
father was a pawnbroker. Lockwood Harris might marry her; he got all his
money from the slave trade. There were three or four more,&mdash;all
wealthy, and all equivocal in position: men to be seen in clubs, to be
dined with and played with; fellows who had yachts at Cowes and
grouse-lodges in Scotland, and yet in London were &ldquo;nowhere.&rdquo; These men
could within their own sphere do all they pleased,&mdash;they could afford
any extravagance they fancied; and what a delightful extravagance it would
be to marry Lizzy Davis! Often as he had envied these men, he never did so
more than now. <i>They</i> had no responsibilities of station ever hanging
over them; no brothers in the Peerage to bully them about this; no sisters
in waiting to worry them about that. They could always, as he phrased it,
&ldquo;paint their coach their own color,&rdquo; without any fear of the Herald's
Office; and what better existence could a man wish for than a prolific
fancy and unlimited funds to indulge it. &ldquo;If I were Stubbs, I 'd marry
her.&rdquo; This he said fully a dozen times over, and even confirmed it with an
oath. And what an amiable race of people are the Stubbses of this
habitable globe! how loosely do responsibilities sit upon them! how
generously are they permitted every measure of extravagance and every
violation of good taste! What a painful contrast did his mind draw between
Stubbs' condition and his own! There was a time, too, when the State
repaired in some sort the injustice that younger sons groaned under,&mdash;the
public service was full of the Lord Charleses and the Honorables, who
looked up to a paternal Government for their support; but now there was
actually a run against them. Beecher argued himself so warmly into this
belief, that he said aloud, &ldquo;If I asked for something to-morrow, they 'd
refuse me, just because I 've a brother a Peer!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The reader is already aware what a compensation he found for all his
defeats and shortcomings in life by arraigning the injustice of the world.
Downing Street, the turf, Lackington, Tattersall's, the Horse Guards, and
&ldquo;the little hell in St. James's Street&rdquo; were all in a league to crush him;
but he'd show them &ldquo;a turn round the corner yet,&rdquo; he said; and with a
saucy laugh of derision at all the malevolence of fortune, he set about
dressing for dinner. Beecher was not only a very good-looking fellow, but
he had that stamp of man of fashion on him which all the contamination of
low habits and low associates had not effaced. His address was easy and
unaffected, his voice pleasantly toned, his smile sufficiently ready; and
his whole manner was an agreeable blending of deference with a sort of not
ungraceful self-esteem. Negatives best describe the class of men he
belonged to, and any real excellence he possessed was in not being a great
number of things which form, unhappily, the social defects of a large
section of humanity. He was never loud, never witty, never oracular, never
anecdotic; and although the slang of the turf and its followers clung to
him, he threw out its &ldquo;dialectics&rdquo; so laughingly that he even seemed to be
himself ridiculing the quaint phraseology he employed.
</p>
<p>
We cannot venture to affirm that our readers might have liked his company,
but we are safe in asserting that Lizzy Davis did so. He possessed that
very experience of life&mdash;London life&mdash;that amused her greatly.
She caught up with an instinctive quickness the meaning of those secret
springs which move society, and where, though genius and wealth are
suffered to exercise their influence, the real power is alone centred in
those who are great by station and hereditary claims. She saw that the
great Brahmins of fashion maintained a certain exclusiveness which no
pretensions ever breached, and that to this consciousness of an
unassailable position was greatly owing all the dignified repose and
serenity of their manner. She made him recount to her the style of living
in the country houses of England,&mdash;the crowds of visitors that came
and went, the field-sports, the home resources that filled up the day,
while intrigues of politics or fashion went silently on beneath the
surface. She recognized that in this apparently easy and indolent
existence a great game was ever being played, and that all the workings of
ambition, all the passions of love and hate and fear and jealousy &ldquo;were on
the board.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
They had dined sumptuously. The equivocal position in which they appeared,
far from detracting from the deference of the hotel people, served but to
increase their homage. Experience had shown that such persons as they were
supposed to be spent most and paid best, and so they were served on the
most splendid plate; waiters in full dress attended them; even to the
bouquet of hothouse flowers left on &ldquo;Mademoiselle's&rdquo; napkin, all were
little evidences of that consideration of which Annesley Beecher well knew
the meaning.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Will you please to enlighten my ignorance on one point, Mr. Beecher?&rdquo;
 said she, as they sat over their coffee. &ldquo;Is it customary in this rigid
England, of which you have told me so many things, for a young unmarried
lady to travel alone with a gentleman who is not even a relative?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;When her father so orders it, I don't see that there can be much wrong in
it,&rdquo; said he, with some hesitation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That is not exactly an answer to my question; although I may gather from
it that the proceeding is, at least, unusual.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I won't say it's quite customary,&rdquo; said Beecher; &ldquo;but taking into account
that I am a very old and intimate friend of your father's&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There must, then, have been some very pressing emergency to make papa
adopt such a course,&rdquo; interrupted she.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; asked he. &ldquo;Is the arrangement so very distasteful to you?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps not; perhaps I like it very well. Perhaps I find you very
agreeable, very amusing, very&mdash;What shall I say?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Respectful.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If you like that epithet, I have no objection to put it in your
character. Yet still do I come back to the thought that papa could
scarcely have struck out this plan without some grave necessity. Now, I
should like much to know what that is, or was.&rdquo; Beecher made no sign of
reply, and she quickly asked, &ldquo;Do you know his reasons?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, gravely; &ldquo;but I prefer that you should not question me
about them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I can't help that, Mr. Beecher,&rdquo; said she, in that half-careless tone she
sometimes used. &ldquo;Just listen to me for one moment,&rdquo; said she, earnestly,
and fixing her eyes fully on him,&mdash;&ldquo;just hear me attentively. From
what I have gathered from your account of England and its habits, I am
certainly now doing that which, to say the least, is most unusual and
unwarrantable. Now, either there is a reason so grave for this that it
makes a choice of evils imperative,&mdash;and, therefore, I ought to have
my choice,&mdash;or there is another even worse interpretation&mdash;at
least, a more painful one&mdash;to come.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Which is?&rdquo; cried he.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That I am not of that station to which such propriety attaches of
necessity.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She uttered these words with a cold sternness and determination that
actually made Beecher tremble. &ldquo;It was Davis's daughter spoke there,&rdquo;
 thought he. &ldquo;They are the words of one who declares that, no matter what
be the odds against her, she is ready to meet the whole world in arms.
What a girl it is!&rdquo; muttered he, with a sense of mingled fear and
admiration.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, Mr. Beecher,&rdquo; said she, at length, &ldquo;I <i>do</i> think you owe me a
little frankness; short as our acquaintance has been, I, at least, have
talked in all the freedom of old friendship. Pray show me that I have not
been indiscreet.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Hang me, if I know what to say or do!&rdquo; cried Beecher, in dire perplexity.
&ldquo;If I were to tell you why your father hurried away from Brussels, <i>he</i>
'd bring me to book very soon, I promise you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I do not ask that,&rdquo; interrupted she, eagerly. &ldquo;It is upon the other point
my interest is most engaged.&rdquo; He looked blankly at her, for he really did
not catch to what she alluded. &ldquo;I want you to tell me, in one word, who
are the Davises? Who are we? If we are not recognizable by that high world
you have told me of, who, then, are our equals? Remember that by an honest
answer to my question you give guidance and direction to my future life.
Do not shrink from fear of giving me pain,&mdash;there is no such pain as
uncertainty; so be frank.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Beecher covered his face with his hands to think over his reply. He did
not dare to look at her, so fearful was he of her reading his very
embarrassment.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I will spare you, sir,&rdquo; said she, smiling half superciliously; &ldquo;but if
you bad known me a little longer or a little better, you had seen how
needless all this excessive caution on your part I have more of what you
call 'pluck' than you give me credit for.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, by Jove! that you have n't,&rdquo; cried Beecher; &ldquo;you have more real
courage than all the men I ever knew.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Show me, then, that you are not deficient in the quality, and give me a
plain answer to a plain question. Who are we?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have just told you,&rdquo; said Beecher, whose confusion now made him stammer
and stutter at every word,&mdash;&ldquo;I have just told you that your father
never spoke to me about his relations. I really don't know his county, nor
anything about his family.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then it only remains to ask, What are we? or, in easier words, Has my
father any calling or profession? Come, sir, so much you can certainly
tell me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your father was a captain in a West India regiment, and, when I met him
first, he was a man about town,&mdash;went to all the races, made his
bets, won and lost, like the rest of us; always popular,&mdash;knew
everybody.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A 'sporting character,' in short,&mdash;is n't that the name newspapers
give it?&rdquo; said she, with a malicious twinkle of the eye.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;By Jove! how you hit a thing off at once!&rdquo; exclaimed Beecher, in honest
ecstasy at her shrewdness.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So, then, I am at the end of the riddle at last,&rdquo; said she, musingly, as
she arose and walked the room in deep meditation. &ldquo;Far better to have told
me so many a year ago; far better to have let me conform to this station
when I might have done so easily and without a pang!&rdquo; A bitter sigh
escaped her at the last word, and Beecher arose and joined her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I hope you are not displeased with me, my dear Miss Davis,&rdquo; said he, with
a trembling voice; &ldquo;I don't know what I'd not rather suffer than offend
you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have <i>not</i> offended me,&rdquo; said she, coldly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I mean, than I 'd pain you,&mdash;than I 'd say anything that
should distress you. You know, after all, it was n't quite fair to push me
so hard.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you forgetting, sir,&rdquo; broke she in, haughtily, &ldquo;that you have really
told me next to nothing, and that I am left to gather from mere
insinuations that there is something in our condition your delicacy
shrinks from explaining?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; chimed he in, quickly. &ldquo;The best men in England are on
the turf, and a good book on the Oaks is n't within reach of the
income-tax. Your father's dealings are with all the swells in the
Peerage.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So there is a partnership in the business, sir,&rdquo; said she, with a quiet
irony; &ldquo;and is the Honorable Mr. Beecher one of the company?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;ha&mdash;I suppose&mdash;I ought to say yes,&rdquo; muttered he, in
deep confusion. &ldquo;We do a stroke of work together now and then&mdash;on the
square, of course, I mean.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pray don't expose the secrets of the firm, sir. I am even more interested
than yourself that they should be conducted with discretion. There is only
one other question I have to ask; and as it purely concerns myself, you
'll not refuse me a reply. Knowing our station in life, as I now see you
know it, by what presumption did you dare to trifle with my girlish
ignorance, and lead me to fancy that I might yet move in a sphere which in
your heart you knew I was excluded from?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Overwhelmed with shame and confusion, and stunned by the embarrassment of
a dull man in a difficulty, Beecher stood, unable to utter a word.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To say the least, sir, there was levity in this,&rdquo; said she, in a tone of
sorrowful meaning; &ldquo;but, perhaps, you never meant it so.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Never, upon my oath, never!&rdquo; cried he, eagerly. &ldquo;Whatever I said, I
uttered in all frankness and sincerity. I know London town just as well as
any man living, and I 'll stand five hundred to fifty there's not your
equal in it,&mdash;and that's giving the whole field against the odds. All
I say is, you shall go to the Queen's Drawing-room&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am not likely to do so, sir,&rdquo; said she, with a haughty gesture, and
left the room.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXXIV. AIX-LA-CHAPELLE
</h2>
<p>
Three days passed over,&mdash;three days varied with all the incidents
that go to make up a longer existence,&mdash;and Beecher and his fair
charge were still in Aix. If they forbore to speak to each other of the
strange situation in which they found themselves, they were not the less
full of it. Neither telegraph nor letter came from Davis, and Beecher's
anxiety grew hourly greater. There was scarcely an eventuality his mind
had not pictured. Davis was arrested and carried off to prison in
Brussels,&mdash;was waylaid and murdered in the Ardennes,&mdash;was ill,
dying in some unheard-of village,&mdash;involved in some other row, and
obliged to keep secret,&mdash;arrested on some old charge; in fact, every
mishap that a fertile fancy could devise had befallen him, and now only
remained the question what was he himself to do with Lizzy Davis.
</p>
<p>
Whether it was that her present life was an agreeable change from the
discipline of the Three Fountains, or that the new objects of interest
about her engaged her to the exclusion of much thought, or that some
higher philosophy of resignation supported her, but certain is it she
neither complained of the delay nor exhibited any considerable impatience
at her father's silence. She went about sightseeing, visited churches and
galleries, strolled on the Promenade, before dinner, and finished with the
theatre at night, frankly owning that it was a kind of do-nothing
existence that she enjoyed greatly. Her extraordinary beauty was already a
town talk; and the passages of the hotel were crowded as she went down to
her carriage, and to her box at the opera were directed almost every glass
in the house. This, however, is a homage not always respectful; and in the
daring looks of the men, and the less equivocal glances of the women,
Beecher read the judgment that had been pronounced upon her. Her manner,
too, in public had a certain fearless gayety about it that was sure to be
severely commented on, while the splendor of her dress was certain to be
not more mercifully interpreted.
</p>
<p>
To have the charge of a casket of jewels through the thieves' quarter of
London was the constant similitude that rose to Beecher's mind as he
descended the stairs at her side. To be obliged to display her to the
wondering gaze of some hundred idlers, the dissipated and debauched
loungers of a watering-place, men of bad lives and worse tongues; to mark
the staring insolence of some, and the quizzical impertinence of others;
to see how narrowly each day they escaped some more overt outrage from
that officious politeness that is tendered to those in equivocal
positions, were tortures that half maddened him. Nor could he warn her of
the peril they stood in, or dare to remonstrate about many little girlish
ways which savored of levity. The scene of the theatre in Brussels was
never off his mind, and the same one idea continually haunted him, that
poor Hamilton's fate might be his own. The characterless men of the world
are always cowards as to responsibility,&mdash;they feel that there is a
flaw in their natures that must smash them if pressed upon; and so was it
here. Beecher's life was actual misery, and each morning he awoke the day
seemed full of menace and misfortune to him. In his heart, he knew that if
an emergency arose he should be found wanting; he 'd either not think of
the right thing, or have pluck for it if he even thought it; and then,
whatever trouble or mishap he came through, there still remained worse
behind,&mdash;the settlement with Grog himself at the end.
</p>
<p>
Like most persons who seek the small consolation of falling back on their
own foresight, he called to mind how often he had said to himself that
nothing but ill could come of journeying with Grog Davis,&mdash;he knew
it, he was sure of it. A fellow to conspire with about a &ldquo;plant&rdquo;&mdash;a
man to concert with on a race or a &ldquo;safe thing with the cards&rdquo;&mdash;was
not exactly a meet travelling-companion, and he fretted over the fatal
weakness that had induced his acceptance of him. They had only just
started, and their troubles had already begun! Even if Davis himself were
there, matters might not be so bad. Grog was always ready to &ldquo;turn out&rdquo;
 and have a shot with any one. It was a sort of pastime he rather liked
when nothing else was stirring, it seemed like keeping his hand in; but,
confound the fellow! he had gone off, and left in his place one who had a
horror of hair-triggers, and shuddered at the very thought of a
shot-wound.
</p>
<p>
He was far too conversant with the habits of <i>demi-monde</i> existence
not to see that the plot was thickening, and fresh dangers clustering
round him. The glances in the street were hourly growing more familiar,&mdash;the
looks were half recognitions. Half a dozen times in the morning,
well-dressed and well-bearded strangers had bolted into their sitting-room
in mistake, and while apologizing for their blunder, delayed unnecessarily
long over the explanation.
</p>
<p>
The waiter significantly mentioned that Prince Bottoffsky was then
stopping at the hotel, with seven carriages and eighteen servants. The
same intelligent domestic wondered they never went to see Count Czapto
witch's camellias,&mdash;&ldquo;he had sent a bouquet of them that very day to
her Ladyship.&rdquo; And Beecher groaned in his spirit as the fellow produced
it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I see how it's all to end,&rdquo; muttered he, as he paced the room, unable any
longer to conceal the misery that was consuming him. &ldquo;One of those
confounded foreigners will come swaggering up to talk to her on the
Promenade, and then I'm 'in for it.' It's all Davis's fault. It's all <i>her</i>
fault. Why can't she look like other people,&mdash;dress like them,&mdash;walk
like them? What stuff and nonsense it is for <i>her</i> to be going about
the world like a Princess Royal! It was only last night she wore a
Brussels lace shawl at the opera that cost five thousand francs; and when
it caught on a nail in the box and was torn, she laughed, and said,
'Annette will be charmed with this disaster, for she was always coveting
this lace, and wondering when she was to have it.' That's the fine
'bring-ing-up' old Grog is so proud of! If she were a Countess in her own
right, with ten thousand a year, she 'd be a bad bargain!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Ah, Beecher! your heart never went with you when you made this cruel
speech; you uttered it in spleen and bitterness, but not in sincerity; for
already in that small compartment of your nature where a few honest
affections yet lingered <i>she was</i> treasured, and, had you known how
to do it, you would have loved her. Poor devil as he was, Life was a hard
battle to him,&mdash;always over head and ears in debt; protested bills
meeting him at every moment; duns rising before him at every turn. Levity
was to him, as to many, a mere mask over Fear, and he walked the world in
the hourly terror that any moment might bring him to shame and ruin. If he
were a few minutes alone, his melancholy was almost despair; and over and
over had he pictured to his mind a scene in the police-court, where he was
called on to find full and sufficient bail for his appearance on trial.
From such sorrowing thoughts he made his escape to rush into society&mdash;anywhere,
anyhow; and, by the revulsion of his mind, came that rattling and
boisterous gayety that made him seem the most light-hearted fellow in
existence. Such men are always making bonfires of their household gods,
and have nothing to greet them when they are at home.
</p>
<p>
What a fascination must Lizzy Davis have exercised over such a mind! Her
beauty and her gracefulness would not have been enough without her
splendid dressing, and that indescribable elegance of manner which was
native to her. Then how she amused him!&mdash;what droll caricatures did
she sketch of the queer originals of the place,&mdash;the bearded old
colonels, or the pretentious loungers that frequented the &ldquo;Cursaal&rdquo;! How
witty the little epigrams by which she accompanied them, and how
charmingly at a moment would she sit down at the piano and sing for him
anything, from a difficult &ldquo;scena&rdquo; from Verdi to some floating barcarole
of Venice! She could&mdash;let us tell it in one breath&mdash;make him
laugh; and oh, dearly valued reader! what would you or I give for the
company of any one who could do as much? The world is full of learned
people and clever people. There are Bourse men, and pre-Raphaelite men,
and Old-red-sandstone men, and Greek-particle men; but where are the
pleasant people one used to chat with long ago, who, though talking of
mere commonplaces, threw out little sparks of fun,&mdash;fireflies in the
dark copses,&mdash;giving to what they said that smack of epigram that
spiced talk but never over-seasoned it, whose genial sympathy sent a warm
life-blood through every theme, and whose outspoken heartiness refreshed
one after a cold bath of polite conventionalities? If they still exist
upon this earth, they must be hiding themselves, wisely seeing it is not
an age to suit them; they lie quiet under the ice, patiently hibernating
till another summer may call them forth to vitality.
</p>
<p>
Now Lizzy Davis could make Beecher laugh in his lowest and gravest
moments; droll situations and comical conceits came in showers over her
mind, and she gave them forth with all the tact of a consummate actress.
Her mimicry, too, was admirable; and thus he who rarely reflected and
never read, found in her ready talents resources against all weariness and
ennui. What a girl she was!&mdash;how perfectly she would become any&mdash;the
very highest&mdash;station! what natural dignity in her manner!&mdash;and&mdash;Then,
after a pause, he murmured, &ldquo;What a fortune she'd make on the stage! Why,
there's nothing to compare with her,&mdash;she's as much beyond them all
in beauty as in genius!&rdquo; And so he set about thinking how, by marrying
her, a man might make a &ldquo;deuced good thing of it.&rdquo; There's no saying what
Webster wouldn't offer; and then there was America, always a &ldquo;safe card;&rdquo;
 not that it would do for himself to think of such a thing. Lackington
would never speak to him again. All his family would cut him dead; he had
n't an acquaintance would recognize him after such disgrace.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Old Grog is <i>so</i> confoundedly well known,&rdquo; muttered he,&mdash;&ldquo;the
scoundrel is <i>so</i> notorious!&rdquo; Still, there were fellows would n't
mind that,&mdash;hard-up men, who had done everything, and found all
failure. He knew&mdash;&ldquo;Let us see,&rdquo; said he to himself, beginning to
count on his fingers all the possible candidates for her hand. &ldquo;There's
Cranshaw Craven at Caen, on two hundred a year; <i>he'd</i> marry her, and
never ask to see her if she 'd settle twenty thousand francs a year on
him. Brownlow Gore would marry her, and for a mere five hundred too, for
he wants to try that new martingale at Ems; he's certain he 'd break the
bank with less. Foley would marry her; but, to be sure, he has a wife
somewhere, and she might object to that! I'd lay an even fifty,&rdquo; cried he,
in ecstasy at the bright thought, &ldquo;Tom Beresford would marry her just to
get out of the Fleet!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What does that wonderful calculation mean?&rdquo; cried she, suddenly, as she
saw him still reckoning on his fingers. &ldquo;What deep process of reasoning is
my learned guardian engaged in?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'd give you a long time to guess,&rdquo; said he, laughing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Am I personally concerned in it?&rdquo; asked she.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that you are!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, after a pause, &ldquo;you are counting over the days we have
passed, or are still to pass here?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, not <i>that!</i>&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are computing, perhaps, one by one, all your fashionable friends who
would be shocked by my levity&mdash;that 's the phrase, I believe,&mdash;meaning
those outspoken impertinences you encourage me to utter about everything
and everybody!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Far from it. I was&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh! of course, you were charmed,&rdquo; broke she in; &ldquo;and so you ought to be,
when one performs so dangerous a trick to amuse you. The audience always
applauds the rope-dancer that perils his neck; and you 'd be worse than
ungrateful not to screen me when I 'm satirized. But it may relieve
somewhat the load of obligation when I say that I utter these things just
to please myself. I bear the world no ill-will, it is true; but I 'm very
fond of laughing at it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;In the name and on behalf of that respectable community, let me return
you my thanks,&rdquo; said he, bowing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;how little I really know of what I ridicule, and so
let my ignorance atone for my ill-nature; and now, to come back, what was
it that you were counting so patiently on your fingers? Not <i>my</i>
faults, I'm certain, or you'd have had both hands.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm afraid I could scarcely tell you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;though somehow I feel
that if I knew you a very little longer, I could tell you almost
anything.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wish you could tell me that this pleasant time was coming. What is
this?&rdquo; asked she, as the waiter entered, and presented her with a
visiting-card.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Monsieur the Count desires to know if Mademoiselle will receive him,&rdquo;
 said the man.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What, how? What does this mean?&rdquo; exclaimed Beecher, in terror and
astonishment.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she, turning to the waiter; &ldquo;say, 'With pleasure.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Gracious mercy!&rdquo; exclaimed Beecher, &ldquo;you don't know what you 're doing.
Have you seen this person before?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Never!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Never heard of him!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said she, with a faint smile, for the sight of his terror amused
her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But who is he, then? How has he dared&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said she, holding behind her back the visiting-card, which he
endeavored to snatch from her hand,&mdash;&ldquo;this is <i>my</i> secret!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;This is intolerable!&rdquo; cried Beecher. &ldquo;What is your father to think of
your admitting a person to visit you,&mdash;an utter stranger,&mdash;a
fellow Heaven knows&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
At this moment, as if to answer in the most palpable form the question he
was propounding, a somewhat sprucely dressed man, middle-aged and comely,
entered; and, passing Beecher by with the indifference he might have
bestowed on a piece of furniture, advanced to where Lizzy was standing,
and, taking her band, pressed it reverently to his lips.
</p>
<p>
So far from resenting the liberty, she smiled most courteously on him, and
motioned to him to take a seat on the sofa beside her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I can't stand this, by Jove!&rdquo; said Beecher, aloud; while, with an
assumption of courage his heart little responded to, he walked straight up
to the stranger. &ldquo;You understand English, I hope?&rdquo; said he, in very
indifferent French.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not a syllable,&rdquo; replied the other, in the same language.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I only know 'All right';&rdquo; and he laughed pleasantly as he uttered the
words in an imitation of English.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come, I 'll not torture you any longer,&rdquo; said Lizzy, laughing; &ldquo;read <i>that</i>.&rdquo;
 And she handed him the card, whereon, in her father's writing, there was,
&ldquo;See the Count; he'll tell you everything.&mdash;C. D.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have heard the name before.&mdash;Count Lienstahl,&rdquo; said Beecher to
himself. &ldquo;Has he seen your father? Where is he?&rdquo; asked he, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He'll inform me on all, if you'll just give him time,&rdquo; said she; while
the Count, with an easy volubility, was pouring out a flow of words
perfectly unintelligible to poor Beecher.
</p>
<p>
Whether it was the pleasure of the tidings he brought, or the delicious
enjoyment of once more hearing and replying in that charming tongue that
she loved so dearly, but Lizzy ceased even to look at Beecher, and only
occupied herself with her new acquaintance.

<p>
Now, while we leave her thus pleasantly engaged, let us present the
visitor to our reader.
</p>
<p>
Nothing could be less like the traditional &ldquo;Continental Count&rdquo; than the
plump, close-shaven, blue-eyed gentlemen who sat beside Lizzy Davis, with
an expression of <i>bonhomie</i> in his face that might have graced a
squire of Devon. He was neither frogged nor moustached; his countenance
neither boded ill to the Holy Alliance, nor any close intimacy with
billiards or dice-boxes. A pleasant, easy-tempered, soft-natured man he
seemed, with a ready smile and a happy laugh, and an air of yielding
good-humor about him that appeared to vouch for his being one none need
ever dispute with. If there were few men less generally known throughout
Europe, there was not one whose origin, family, fortune, and belonging
were wrapped in more complete obscurity. Some said he was a Pomeranian,
others called him a Swede; many believed him Russian, and a few, affecting
deeper knowledge, declared he was from Dalmatia. He was a Count, however,
of somewhere, and as certainly was he one who had the <i>entrée</i> to all
the best circles of the Continent, member of its most exclusive clubs, and
the intimate of those who prided themselves on being careful in their
friendships. While his manners were sufficiently good to pass muster
anywhere, there was about him a genial kindliness, a sort of perennial
pleasantry, that was welcome everywhere; he brought to society that
inestimable gift of adhesiveness by which cold people and stiff people are
ultimately enabled to approximate and understand each other. No matter how
dull and ungenial the salon, he was scarcely across the doorway when you
saw that an element of social kindliness had just been added, and in his
little caressing ways and coaxing inquiries you recognized one who would
not let condescension crush nor coldness chill him. If young people were
delighted to see one so much their senior indulging in all the gay and
light frivolities of life, older folk were gratified to find themselves so
favorably represented by one able to dance, sing, and play like the
youngest in company. So artfully, too, did he contribute his talent to
society, that no thought of personal display could ever attach to him. It
was all good-nature; he played to amuse <i>you</i>,&mdash;he danced to
gratify some one else; he was full of little attentions of a thousand
kinds, and you no more thought of repayment than you'd have dreamed of
thanking the blessed sun for his warmth or his daylight. Such men are the
<i>bonbons</i> of humanity, and even they who do not care for sweet things
are pleased to see them.
</p>
<p>
If his birth and origin were mysterious, far more so were his means of
life. Nobody ever heard of his agent or his banker. He neither owned nor
earned, and yet there he was, as well dressed, as well cared for, and as
pleasant a gentleman as you could see. He played a little, but it was
notorious that he was ever a loser. He was too constantly a winner in the
great game of life to be fortunate as a gambler, and he could well afford
to laugh at this one little mark of spitefulness in Fortune. Racing and
races were a passion with him; but he loved sport for itself, not as a
speculation,&mdash;so, at least, he said; and when he threw his arm over
your shoulder, and said anything in that tone of genial simplicity that
was special to him, I 'd like to have seen the man&mdash;or, still more,
the woman&mdash;who would n't have believed him.
</p>
<p>
The turf&mdash;like poverty&mdash;teaches one to know strange bed-fellows;
and this will explain how the Count and Grog Davis became acquaintances,
and something more.
</p>
<p>
The grand intelligence who discovered the great financial problem of
France&mdash;the <i>Crédit Mobilier</i>&mdash;has proclaimed to the world
that the secret lay in the simple fact that there were industrial energies
which needed capital, and capital which needed industry, and that all he
avowed to accomplish was to bring these two distant but all necessary
elements into close union and co-operation. Now, something of the same
kind moved Grog and the Count to cement their friendship; each saw that
the other supplied some want of his own nature, and before they had passed
an hour together they ratified an alliance. An instinct whispered to each,
&ldquo;We are going the same journey in life, let us travel together;&rdquo; and some
very profitable tours did they make in company!
</p>
<p>
His presence now was on a special mission from Davis, whom he just met at
Treves, and who despatched him to request his daughter to come on to
Carlsruhe, where he would await her. The Count was charged to explain, in
some light easy way of his own, why her father had left Brussels so
abruptly; and he was also instructed to take Annesley Beecher into his
holy keeping, and not suffer him to fall into indiscretions, or adventure
upon speculations of his own devising.
</p>
<p>
Lizzy thought him &ldquo;charming,&rdquo;&mdash;far more worldly-wise people than
Lizzy had often thought the same. There was a bubbling fountain of
good-humor about him that seemed inexhaustible. He was always ready for
any plan that promised pleasure. Unlike Beecher, who knew nobody, the
Count walked the street in a perpetual salutation,&mdash;bowing,
hand-shaking, and sometimes kissing, as he went; and in that strange
polyglot that he talked he murmured as he went, &ldquo;Ah, lieber Freund!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Come
sta?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Addio!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Mon meilleur ami!&rdquo; to each that passed; so
that veritably the world did seem only peopled with those who loved him.
</p>
<p>
As for Beecher, notwithstanding a certain distrust at the beginning, he
soon fell captive to a manner that few resisted; and though the
intercourse was limited to shaking hands and smiling at each other, the
Count's pleasant exclamation of &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; with a jovial slap on the
shoulder, made him feel that he was a &ldquo;regular trump,&rdquo; and a man &ldquo;to
depend on.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
One lurking thought alone disturbed this esteem,&mdash;he was jealous of
his influence over Lizzy; he marked the pleasure with which she listened
to him, the eager delight she showed when he came, her readiness to sing
or play for him. Beecher saw all these in sorrow and bitterness; and
though twenty times a day he asked himself, &ldquo;What the deuce is it to me,&mdash;how
can it possibly matter to <i>me</i> whom she cares for?&rdquo; the haunting
dread never left his mind, and became his very torturer. But why should he
worry himself about it at all? The fellow did what he liked with every
one. Rivers, the sulky training-groom, that would not have let a Royal
Highness see &ldquo;the horse,&rdquo; actually took Klepper out and galloped him for
the Count. The austere landlady of the inn was smiles and courtesy to him;
even to that unpolished class, the hackney coachmen, his blandishments
extended, and they vied with each other who should serve him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We are to start for Wiesbaden to-morrow,&rdquo; said Lizzy to Beecher.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why so,&mdash;who says so?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Count&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Si, si, andiamo,&mdash;all right!&rdquo; cried the Count, laughing; and the
march was ordered.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXXV. A FOREIGN COUNT.
</h2>
<p>
The announcement of Count Lienstahl's arrival at Wiesbaden was received
with rejoicing. &ldquo;Now we shall open the season in earnest. We shall have
balls, picnics, races, hurdle-matches, gypsy parties, excursions by land
and water. <i>He</i> 'll manage everything and everybody.&rdquo; Such were the
exclamations that resounded along the Promenade as the party drove up to
the hotel. Within less than an hour the Count had been to Beberich to
visit the reigning Duke, he had kissed hands with half-a-dozen serene
highnesses, made his bow to the chief minister and the Governor of
Wiesbaden, and come back to dinner all smiles and delight at the
condescension and kindness of the court and the capital.
</p>
<p>
If Lienstahl's popularity was great, he only shared a very humble portion
of public attention when they appeared at the <i>table d'hote</i>. There
Lizzy Davis attracted every look, and the fame of her beauty was already
wide-spread. Such was the eagerness to obtain place at the table that the
most extravagant bribes were offered for a seat, and a well-known elegant
of Vienna actually paid a waiter five louis to cede his napkin to him and
let him serve in his stead. Beecher was anything but gratified at these
demonstrations. If his taste was offended, his fears were also excited.
&ldquo;Something bad must come of it,&rdquo; was his own muttered reflection; and as
they retired after dinner to take their coffee, he showed very palpably
his displeasure.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Eh, <i>caro mio</i>,&mdash;all right?&rdquo; said the Count, gayly, as he threw
an arm over his shoulder.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, by Jove!&mdash;all wrong. I don't like it. It's not the style of
thing I fancy.&rdquo; And here his confusion overwhelmed him, and he stopped
abruptly; for the Count, seating himself at the piano, and rattling off a
lively prelude, began a well-known air from a popular French vaudeville,
of which the following is a rude version:&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;With a lovely face beside you,
You can't walk this world far,
But from those who 've closely eyed you,
Comes the question, Who are you?

And though Dowagers will send you
Cutting looks and glances keen,
The men will comprehend you
When you say, 'C'est ma cousine.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
He was preparing for the second verse when Lizzy entered the room, and,
turning at once to her, he poured forth some sentences with all that
voluble rapidity he possessed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So,&rdquo; said she, addressing Beecher, &ldquo;it seems that you are shocked or
horrified, or your good taste is outraged, by certain demonstrations of
admiration for me exhibited by the worthy public of this place; and, shall
I own to you, I liked it I thought it very nice, and very flattering, and
all that, until I thought it was a little&mdash;a very little, perhaps,
but still a little&mdash;impertinent Was that your opinion?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
There was a blunt frankness about this question, uttered in such palpable
honesty of intention that Beecher felt overwhelmed at once.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don't know the Continent like your friend there. I can't pretend to
offer you advice and counsel like him; but if you really ask me, I 'd say,
'Don't dine below any more; don't go to the rooms of an evening; don't
frequent the Promenade&mdash;&ldquo;'
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What would you say to my taking the veil, for I fancy I 've some vocation
that way?&rdquo; And then, turning to the Count, she said something in French,
at which he laughed immoderately.
</p>
<p>
Whether vexed with himself or with her, or, more probably still, annoyed
by not being able to understand what passed in a foreign language, Beecher
took his hat and left the room. Without his ever suspecting it, a new pang
was just added to his former griefs, and he was jealous! It is very rare
that a man begins by confessing a sense of jealousy to his own heart; he
usually ascribes the dislike he feels to a rival to some defect or some
blemish in his nature. He is a coarse fellow; rude, vulgar, a coxcomb, or,
worst of all, a bore. In some such disposition as this Beecher quitted the
town, and strolled away into the country. He felt he hated the Count, and
yet he could not perceive why; Lienstahl possessed a vast number of the
qualities he was generally disposed to like. He was gay, lively,
light-hearted, never out of humor, never even thoughtful; his was that
easy temperament that seemed to adapt itself to every phase of life. What
was it, then? What could it be that he disliked about him? It was somewhat
&ldquo;cool,&rdquo; too, of Grog, to send this fellow over without even the courtesy
of a line to himself. &ldquo;Serve him right&mdash;serve them all right&mdash;if
I were to cut my lucky;&rdquo; and he ruminated long and anxiously over the
thought. His present position was anything but pleasant or flattering to
him. For aught <i>he</i> knew, the Count and Lizzy Davis passed their time
laughing at his English ignorance of all things foreign. By dint of a good
deal of such self-tormenting, he at last reached that point whereat the
very slightest additional impulse would have determined him to decamp from
his party, and set out all alone for Italy. The terror of a day of
reckoning with Davis was, however, a dread that he could never shake off.
Grog the unforgiving, the inexorable! Grog, whose greatest boast in his
vainglorious moments was that, in the &ldquo;long run,&rdquo; no man ever got the
better of him, would assuredly bring him to book one day or other; and he
knew the man's nature well enough to be aware that no fear of personal
consequences would ever balk him on the road to a vengeance.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes the thought occurred to him that he would make a frank and full
confession to Lackington of all his delinquencies, even to that terrible
&ldquo;count&rdquo; by which the fame and fortune of his house might be blasted
forever. If he could but string up his courage to this pitch, Lackington
might &ldquo;pull him through,&rdquo; Lackington would see that &ldquo;there was nothing
else for it,&rdquo; and so on. It is marvellous what an apparent strength of
argument lies in those slang expressions familiar to certain orders of
men. These conventionalities seem to settle at once questions which, if
treated in more befitting phraseology, would present the gravest
difficulties.
</p>
<p>
He walked on and on, and at last gained a pine wood which skirted the base
of a mountain, and soon lost himself in its dark recesses. Gloomier than
the place itself was the tone of his reflections. All that he might have
been, all that lay so easily within his reach, all that life once offered
him, contrasted bitterly with what he now saw himself. Conscience, it is
true, suggested few of his present pangs; he believed&mdash;ay, sincerely
believed&mdash;that he had been more &ldquo;sinned against than sinning.&rdquo; Such a
one had &ldquo;let him in&rdquo; here; such another &ldquo;had sold him&rdquo; there. In his
reminiscences he saw himself trustful, generous, and confiding, while the
world&mdash;the great globe that includes Tattersalls, Goodwood,
Newmarket, and Ascot&mdash;was little better than a nest of knaves and
vagabonds.
</p>
<p>
Why could n't Lackington get him something abroad,&mdash;in the Brazils or
Lima, for instance? He was n't quite sure where they were; but they were
far away, he thought,&mdash;places too remote for Grog Davis to hunt him
out, and whence he could give the great Grog a haughty defiance. They&mdash;how
it would have puzzled him to say who &ldquo;they&rdquo; were&mdash;they couldn't
refuse Lackington if he asked. He was always voting and giving his
proxies, and doing all manner of things for them; he made a speech, too,
last year at Hoxton, and gave a lecture upon something that must have
served them. Lackington would begin the old story about character; &ldquo;but
who had character nowadays?&rdquo; &ldquo;Take down the Court Guides,&rdquo; cried he,
aloud, &ldquo;and let <i>me</i> give you the private life and adventures of each
as you read out the names. Talk of <i>me!</i> why, what have I done equal
to what Lockwood, Hepton, Bulkleigh, Frank Melton, and fifty more have
done? No, no; for public life, now, they must do as a sergeant of the
Ninety-fifth told me t' other day, 'We 're obliged to take 'em little,
sir, and glad to get 'em too!'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It might be that there was something grateful to his feelings, reassuring
to his heart, in this reflection, for he walked along now more briskly,
and his head higher than before. Without being aware, he had already gone
some miles from the town, and now found himself in one of those long
grassy alleys which traversed the dense wood in various directions. As he
looked down the narrow road which seemed like the vast aisle of some
Gothic cathedral, he felt a sort of tremulous motion beneath his feet; and
then, the moment after, he could detect the measured tramp of a horse at
speed. A slight bend of the alley had hitherto shut out the view; but,
suddenly, a dark object came sweeping round the turn and advancing towards
him.
</p>
<p>
<a name="linkimage-0015" id="linkimage-0015">
<!-- IMG --></a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
<img src="images/10392.jpg" width="100%" alt="392 " />
</div>
<p>
Half to secure a position, and half with the thought of watching what this
might portend, Beecher stepped aside into the dense brushwood at the side
of the alley, and which effectually hid him from view. He had barely time
to make his retreat when a horse swept past him at full stride, and with
one glance he recognized him as &ldquo;Klepper.&rdquo; It was Rivers, too, who rode
him, sitting high over the saddle and with his hands low, as if racing.
Now, it was but that very morning Rivers had told him that the horse was
not &ldquo;quite right,&rdquo;&mdash;a bit heavy or so about the eyes,&mdash;&ldquo;out of
sorts&rdquo; he called it; and there he was now, flying along at the top of his
speed in full health and condition. It needed but the fortieth part of
this to suggest a suspicion to such a mind as his, and with the speed of
lightning there flashed across him the notion of a &ldquo;cross.&rdquo; He, Annesley
Beecher, was to be &ldquo;put into the hole,&rdquo; to be &ldquo;squared,&rdquo; and &ldquo;nobbled,&rdquo;
 and all the rest of it! It did not, indeed, occur to him how very
unprofitably such an enterprise would reward its votaries, that it would
be a most gratuitous iniquity to &ldquo;push him to the wall,&rdquo; that all the
ingenious malevolence in the world could never make the venture &ldquo;pay;&rdquo; his
self-conceit smothered these reasonings, and he determined to watch and to
see how the scheme was to be developed. He had not to wait long in
suspense; at the bend of the alley where the horse had disappeared, two
horsemen were now seen slowly approaching him. As they drew nearer,
Beecher could mark that they were in close, and what seemed confidential
conversation. One he quickly recognized to be the Count; the other, to his
amazement, was Spicer, of whose arrival at Aix he had not heard anything.
They moved so slowly past the spot where he was standing that he could
gather some of the words that escaped them, although being in French. The
sound of his own name quickly caught his ear. It was the Count spoke as
they came up,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He is a <i>pauvre sire</i>, this Beecher, and I don't yet see what use he
can be to us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Davis likes him, or, at least, he wants him,&rdquo; replied Spicer, &ldquo;and that's
enough for us. Depend upon it, Grog makes no mistakes.&rdquo; The other laughed;
but what he replied was lost in the distance?
</p>
<p>
It was some time ere Beecher could summon resolution to leave the place of
his concealment and set out towards the town. Of all the sentiments that
swayed and controlled him, none had such a perfect mastery over his nature
as distrust. It was, in fact, the solitary lesson his life's experience
had taught him. He fancied that he could trace every mistake he had ever
made, every failure he had ever incurred, to some unlucky movement of
credulity on his own part, and that &ldquo;believing&rdquo; was the one great error of
his whole life. He had long been of opinion that high station and
character had no greater privileges than the power they possessed of
imposing a certain trustfulness in their pledges, and that the great
&ldquo;pull&rdquo; a duke had over a &ldquo;leg&rdquo; was that his Grace would be believed in
preference. But it also appeared to him that rogues were generally true to
each other; now, if this last hope were to be taken away, what was there
left in life to cling to? Spicer had said, &ldquo;Davis wants him.&rdquo; What did
that mean?&mdash;what could it mean? Simply that Grog found him, not an
associate or colleague, but a convenient tool. What an intolerable insult,
that he, the Honorable Annesley Beecher, whose great connections rambled
through half Debrett, was to be accounted a mere outpost sentry in the
corps of Grog Davis!
</p>
<p>
His anger increased as he went along. The wound to his self-esteem was in
the very tenderest spot of his nature. Had any man ever sacrificed so much
to be a sharp fellow as he had? Who had, like him, given up friends,
station, career, and prospects? Who had voluntarily surrendered the
society of his equals, and gone down to the very dregs of mankind, just to
learn that one great secret? And was it to be all in vain? Was all his
training and teaching to go for nothing? Was he, after descending to the
ranks, to discover that he never could learn the manual exercise? How
often, in the gloomiest hours of his disappointment, had he hugged the
consolation to his heart, that Grog Davis knew and valued him! &ldquo;Ask G. D.
if I'm a flat,&rdquo; was the proud rejoinder he would hurl at any attempt to
depreciate his shrewdness. What was to become of him, then, if the bank
that held all his fortune were to fail? If Beecher deemed a sharp fellow
the most enviable of all mortals, so he regarded a dupe as the meanest and
most miserable, and the very thought of such a fate was almost maddening.
&ldquo;No, confound me! they sha'n't have it to say that they 'landed' A. B.;
they shall never boast they nobbled me,&rdquo; cried he, warming with the
indignation that worked within him. &ldquo;I 'm off, and this time without beat
of drum. Davis may do his worst. I'll lie by snug for a year or two. There
must be many a safe spot in Germany or Italy, where a man may defy
detection.&rdquo; And then he ran over in his mind all the successful devices he
had seen adopted for disguising a man's appearance. Howard Vane had a wig
and whiskers that left him unrecognized by his own mother; Crofton
Campbell travelled with Inspector Field in search of himself, all by means
of a nose. It was wonderful what science was accomplishing every day for
the happiness and welfare of mankind!
</p>
<p>
The plan of escape was not without its difficulties, however. First of
all, he had no money. Davis had given him merely enough to pay railroad
fares and the charges incidental to the road, and he was living at the
hotel on credit. This was a serious obstacle, but it was also one which
had so often before occurred in Beecher's experience that he was not so
much dismayed by it as many another might have been. &ldquo;Money was always to
be had somehow,&rdquo; was a golden rule of his philosophy, the somehow meaning
that it resolved itself into a simple question of skill and address of the
individual in want of it Aix was a considerable town, much frequented by
strangers, and must, doubtless, possess all the civilizing attributes of
other cities,&mdash;namely, Jews, money-lenders, and discounters. Then,
the landlord of the inn; it was always customary to give him the
preference in these cases. <i>He 'd</i> surely not refuse an advance of a
few hundred francs to a man who came accompanied as he was. Klepper alone
was good security for ten times more than he needed. Must it be confessed
that he felt elevated in his own esteem when he had resolved upon this
scheme? It savored of shrewdness,&mdash;that great touchstone of capacity
which he revered so highly. &ldquo;They shall see if I'm a flat, this time,&rdquo;
 chuckled he to himself as he went along; and he stepped out briskly in the
excitement of self-approval. Then he went over in his mind all the angry
commentaries that would be passed upon his flight,&mdash;the passionate
fury of Grog, the amazement of Spicer, the almost incredulous surprise of
the Count,&mdash;till at last he came to Lizzy; and then, for the first
time in all his calculations, a sense of shame sent the color to his
cheek, and he blushed till his face grew crimson. &ldquo;Ay, by Jove! what will
<i>she</i> think!&rdquo; muttered he, in a voice of honest truthfulness. How he
should appear to her&mdash;how he should stand in her estimation&mdash;after
such an ignoble desertion, was a thought not to be encountered by
self-praises of his cunning. What would her &ldquo;pluck&rdquo; say to his
&ldquo;cowardice,&rdquo; was a terrible query.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXXVI. A COUNTRY VISIT
</h2>
<p>
Let us now return to the Hermitage, and the quiet lives of those who dwelt
there. Truly, to the traveller gazing down from some lofty point of the
Glengariff road upon that lowly cottage deep buried in its beech wood, and
only showing rare glimpses of its trellised walls, nothing could better
convey the idea of estrangement from the world and its ambitions. From the
little bay, where the long low waves swept in measured cadence on the
sands, to the purple-clad mountains behind, the scene was eminently calm
and peaceful. The spot was precisely one to suggest the wisdom of that
choice which prefers tranquil obscurity to the struggle and conflict of
the great world. What a happy existence would you say was theirs, who
could drop down the stream of a life surrounded with objects of such
beauty, free to indulge each rising fancy, and safe from all the
collisions of mankind!&mdash;how would one be disposed to envy the
unbroken peacefulness that no ambitions ruffled, no rude disappointments
disturbed! And yet such speculations as these are ever faulty, and
wherever the human heart throbs, there will be found its passions, its
hopes and fears. Beneath that quiet roof there dwelt all the elements that
make the battle of life; and high aspirings and ignoble wishes, and love
and fear, and jealousy, and wealth-seeking lived there, as though the spot
were amidst the thundering crash of crowded streets and the din of passing
thousands!
</p>
<p>
Sybella Kellett had been domesticated there about two months, and between
Lady Augusta and herself there had grown a sort of intimacy,&mdash;short,
indeed, of friendship, but in which each recognized good qualities in the
other.
</p>
<p>
Had Miss Kellett been older, less good-looking, less grace-ful in manner,
or generally less attractive, it is just possible that&mdash;we say it
with all doubt and deference&mdash;Lady Augusta might have been equally
disposed to feel satisfied. She suspected &ldquo;Mr. Dunn must have somewhat
mistaken the object of her note,&rdquo; or &ldquo;overlooked the requirements they
sought for.&rdquo; Personal attractions were not amongst the essentials she had
mentioned. &ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; too, was amazed at his recommending a &ldquo;mere girl,&rdquo;&mdash;she
couldn't be more than &ldquo;twenty,&rdquo;&mdash;and, consequently, &ldquo;totally
deficient in the class of knowledge he desired.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Two months,&mdash;no very long period,&mdash;however, sufficed to show
both father and daughter that they had been, to some extent, mistaken. Not
only had she addressed herself to the task of an immense correspondence,
but she had drawn out reports, arranged prospectuses, and entered into
most complicated financial details with a degree of clearness that
elicited marked compliment from the different bodies with whom this
intercourse was maintained. The Glengariff Joint Stock Company, with its
half-million capital, figured largely in the public journals. Landscapes
of the place appeared in the various illustrated papers, and cleverly
written magazine articles drew attention to a scheme that promised to make
Ireland a favored portion of the empire. Her interest once excited,
Sybella Kellett's zeal was untiring.
</p>
<p>
Already she anticipated the time when the population of that poor village&mdash;now
barely subsisting in direst poverty&mdash;should become thriving and
happy. The coast-fisheries&mdash;once a prolific source of wealth&mdash;were
to be revived; fishing-craft and tackle and curing-houses were all to be
provided; means of transporting the proceeds to the rich markets of
England procured; she had also discovered traces of lead in the
neighborhood; and Dunn was written to, to send down a competent person to
investigate the matter. In fact, great as was her industry, it seemed only
second to an intelligence that adapted itself to every fresh demand and
every new exigency, without a moment's interruption. To the old Lord her
resources appeared inexhaustible, and gradually he abandoned the lead and
guidance he had formerly given to his plans, and submitted everything to
her will and dictation. It did not, indeed, escape his shrewdness that her
zeal was more warmly engaged by the philanthropy than by the profit of
these projects. It was to the advancement of the people, the relief of
their misery, the education of their children, the care of their sick,
that she looked as the great reward of all that they proposed. &ldquo;What a
lesson we shall teach the rest of Ireland if we 'succeed'!&rdquo; was the
constant exclamation she uttered. &ldquo;How we shall be sought after to explain
this and reveal that! What a proud day for us will it be when Glengariff
shall be visited as the model school of the empire!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Thus fed and fostered by her hopes, her imagination knew no bounds, and
the day seemed even too short for the duties it exacted. Even Lady Augusta
could not avoid catching some of the enthusiasm that animated her, only
restraining her expectations, however, by the cautious remark, &ldquo;I wonder
what Mr. Dunn will say. I am curious to know how he will pronounce upon it
all.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The day at last came when this fact was to be ascertained, and the post
brought the brief but interesting intelligence that Mr. Davenport Dunn
would reach the Hermitage for dinner.
</p>
<p>
Lord Glengariff would have felt excessively offended could any one have
supposed him anxious or uneasy on the score of Dunn's coming. That a great
personage like himself should be compelled occasionally in life to descend
to the agencies of such people was bad enough, but that he should have any
misgivings about his co-operation or assistance, was really intolerable;
and yet, we blush to confess, these were precisely the thoughts which
troubled his Lordship throughout the whole of that long day.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not that Dunn has ever forgotten himself with <i>me</i>,&mdash;not that
he has ever shown himself unmindful of our respective stations,&mdash;so
much I must say,&rdquo; were the little scraps of consolation that he repeated
over and over to himself, while grave doubts really oppressed him that we
had fallen upon evil days, when men of that stamp usurped almost all the
influence that swayed society. No easy matter was it, either, to resolve
what precise manner to assume towards him. A cold and dignified bearing
might possibly repel all confidence, and an easy familiarity be just as
dangerous as surrendering the one great superiority his position
conferred. It was true his Lordship had never yet experienced any
difficulty on such a score,&mdash;of all men, he possessed a consummate
sense of his own dignity, and suffered none to infringe it; but &ldquo;this
fellow Dunn had been spoiled.&rdquo; Great men&mdash;greater men than Lord
Glengariff himself&mdash;had asked him to dinner. He had passed the
thresholds of certain fine houses in Piccadilly, and well-powdered lackeys
in Park Lane had called &ldquo;Mr. Dunn's carriage.&rdquo; Now, the Irishman that has
soared to the realm of whitebait with a minister, or even a Star and
Garter luncheon with a Secretary of State, becomes, to the eyes of his
home-bred countrymen, a very different person from the celebrity of mere
Castle attentions and Phoenix Park civilities. Dunn was this, and more. He
lounged into the Irish Office as into his own lodgings, and he walked into
the most private chambers of Downing Street as if by right. Consulted or
not, he had the reputation of holding the patronage of all Ireland in his
hands; and assuredly they who attained promotion were not slow in
testifying to what quarter they owed their gratitude. Some of that
mysterious grandeur that clung to the old religions of the Greeks seems to
hover round the acts of a great Government, till the Ministers, like
Priests or Augurs, appear less equals and fellow-men than stewards and
dispensers of immense bounties intrusted to their keeping. There was about
Dunn's manner much to foster this illusion. He was a blending of mystery
with the deepest humility, but with a very evident desire that you should
neither believe one nor the other. It was the same conscious power looming
through the affected modesty of his pretensions that offended Lord
Glengariff, and made him irritable in all his intercourse with him.
</p>
<p>
Let us take a passing glance at Lady Augusta. And why, may we ask, has she
taken such pains about her toilette to-day? Not that her dress is
unusually rich or costly, but she has evidently made a study of the
&ldquo;becoming,&rdquo; and looks positively handsome. She remembered something of a
fuchsia in her hair, long, long ago; and now, by mere caprice of course,
she has interwoven one in those dark clusters, never glossier nor more
silky. Her calm, cold features, too, have caught up a gentler expression,
and her voice is softer and lower. Her maid can make nothing of it. Lady
Augusta has been so gracious and so thoughtful, and asked about her poor
old sick grandmother. Well, these sunlights are meant to show what the
coldest landscapes may become when smiled on by brighter skies!
</p>
<p>
And Sybella. Pale and melancholy, and in mourning, she, too, has caught up
a sense of pleasure at the coming visit, and a faint line of color tinges
her white cheek. She is very glad that Mr. Dunn is expected. &ldquo;She has to
thank him for many kindnesses; his prompt replies to her letters; his good
nature to poor Jack, for whom he has repeatedly written to the Horse
Guards; not to speak of the words of encouragement and hope he has
addressed to herself. Yes, he is, indeed, her friend; perhaps her only
friend in the world.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And now they are met in the drawing-room, waiting with anxiety for some
sounds that may denote the great man's coming. The three windows open to
the ground; the rich sward, spangled here and there with carnations or
rich-scented stocks, slopes down towards a little river, from the bridge
over which a view is caught of the Glen-gariff road; and to this spot each
as silently loitered, and as listlessly turned back again without a word.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We are waiting for Mr. Dunn, Augusta, ain't we?&rdquo; asked Lord Glengariff,
as if the thought had just suddenly struck him for the first time.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied she, gravely; &ldquo;he promised us his company to-day at
dinner.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you quite sure it was to-day he mentioned?&rdquo; said he, with an affected
indifference in his tone.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Miss Kellett can inform us with certainty.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He said Thursday, and in time for dinner,&rdquo; said Sybella, not a little
puzzled by this by-play of assumed forgetfulness.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The man who makes his own appointments ought to keep them. I am five
minutes beyond the half-hour,&rdquo; said Lord Glengariff, as he looked at his
watch.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I suspect you are a little fast,&rdquo; observed Lady Augusta.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There!&mdash;I think I heard the crack of a postilion's whip,&rdquo; cried
Sybella, as she went outside the window to listen. Lady Augusta followed,
and was soon at her side.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You appear anxious for Mr. Dunn's coming. Is he a <i>very</i> intimate
friend of yours, Miss Kellett?&rdquo; said she, with a keen, quick glance of her
dark eyes.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He was the kind friend of my father, when he lived, and, since his death,
he has shown himself not less mindful of me. There&mdash;I hear the horses
plainly! Can't you hear them now, Lady Augusta?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And how was this kindness evidenced,&mdash;in your own case I mean?&rdquo; said
Lady Augusta, not heeding her question.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;By advice, by counsel, by the generous interference which procured for me
my present station here, not to speak of the spirit of his letters to me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So then you correspond with him?&rdquo; asked she, reddening suddenly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she, turning her eyes fully on the other. And thus they stood
for some seconds, when, with a slight, but very slight, motion of
impatience, Lady Augusta said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was not aware&mdash;I mean, I don't remember your having mentioned this
circumstance to me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I should have done so if I thought it could have had any interest for
you,&rdquo; said Sybella, calmly. &ldquo;Oh, there is the carriage coming up the
drive; I knew I was not mistaken.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Lady Augusta made no reply, but returned hastily to the house. Bella
paused for a few seconds, and followed her.
</p>
<p>
No sooner was Mr. Dunn's carriage seen approaching the little bridge over
the stream than Lord Glengariff rang to order dinner.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It will be a rebuke he well merits,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to find the soup on the
table as he drives up.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
There was something more than a mere movement of irritation in this; his
Lordship regarded it as a fine stroke of policy, by which Dunn's arrival,
tinged with constraint and awkwardness, should place that gentleman at a
disadvantage during the time he stayed, Lord Glengariff's favorite theory
being that &ldquo;these people were insufferable when at their ease.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Ah, my Lord, your memory was picturing the poor tutor of twenty years
before, snubbed and scoffed at for his ungainly ways and ill-made
garments,&mdash;the man heavy in gait and awkward in address, sulky when
forgotten, and shy when spoken to,&mdash;this was the Davenport Dunn of
your thoughts; there the very door <i>he</i> used to creep through in
bashful confusion, yonder the side-table where he dined in a mockery of
consideration. Little, indeed, were you prepared for him whose assured
voice was already heard outside giving orders to his servant, and who now
entered the drawing-room with all the ease of a man of the world.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, Dunn, most happy to see you here. No accident, I trust, occurred to
detain you,&rdquo; said Lord Glengariff, meeting him with a well-assumed
cordiality, and then, not waiting for his reply, went on: &ldquo;My daughter,
Lady Augusta, an old acquaintance&mdash;if you have not forgotten her.
Miss Kellett you are acquainted with.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mr. Dunn bowed twice, and deeply, before Lady Augusta, and then, passing
across the room, shook hands warmly with Sybella.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How did you find the roads, Dunn?&rdquo; asked his Lordship, still fishing
about for some stray word of apology; &ldquo;rather heavy, I fear, at this
season.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Capital roads, my Lord, and excellent horses. We came along at a rate
which would have astonished the lumbering posts of the Continent.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Dinner, my Lord,&rdquo; said the butler, throwing wide the folding-doors.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Will you give Lady Augusta your arm, Dunn?&rdquo; said Lord Glengariff, as he
offered his own to Miss Kellett.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We have changed our dinner-room, Mr. Dunn,&rdquo; said Lady Augusta, as they
walked along; thus by a mere word suggesting &ldquo;bygones and long ago.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And with advantage, I should say,&rdquo; replied he, easily, as he surveyed the
spacious and lofty apartment into which they had just entered. &ldquo;The old
dinner-room was low-ceilinged and gloomy.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you really remember it?&rdquo; asked she, with a pleasant smile.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;An over-good memory has accompanied me through life, Lady Augusta,&rdquo; said
he. And then, as he remarked the rising color of her cheek, quickly added,
&ldquo;It is rarely that the faculty treats me to such grateful recollections as
the present.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Lord Glengariffs table was a good specimen of country-house living. All
the materials were excellent, and the cookery reasonably good; his wine
was exquisite,&mdash;the years and epochs connoisseurship loves to dwell
upon; but Mr. Dunn ate sparingly and drank little. He had passed forty
without gourmand tastes, and no man takes to epicurism after that. His
Lordship beheld, not without secret dissatisfaction, his curdiest salmon
declined, his wonderful &ldquo;south-down&rdquo; sent away scarcely tasted, and,
horror of horrors! saw water mixed with his 1815 claret as if it were a
&ldquo;little Bordeaux wine&rdquo; at a Swiss <i>table d'hôte</i>.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Dunn has no appetite for our coarse country fare, Augusta,&rdquo; said Lord
Glengariff; &ldquo;you must take him over the cliffs, to-morrow, and let him
feel the sharp Glengariff air. There's nothing but hunger for it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pardon me, my Lord, if I say that I accept with gratitude the proposed
remedy, though I don't acknowledge a just cause for it. I am always a poor
eater.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Tell him of Beverley, Augusta, tell him of Beverley,&rdquo; said my Lord.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it was simply a case similar to your own,&rdquo; said she, hesitatingly,
&ldquo;and, in all probability, incurred in the same way. The Duke of Beverley,
a very hard-worked man, as you know, always at Downing Street at ten, and
never leaving it till night, came here two years ago, to pass a few weeks
with us, and although hale and stout, to look at, could eat nothing,&mdash;that
is, he cared for nothing. It was in vain we put in requisition all our
little culinary devices to tempt him; he sat down with us, and, like
yourself, would fain persuade us that he dined, but he really touched
nothing; and, in utter despair, I determined to try what a course of open
air and exercise would do.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;She means eight hours a day hard walking, Dunn,&rdquo; chimed in Lord
Glengariff; &ldquo;a good grouse-shooter's pace, too, and cross country.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, confess that my remedy succeeded,&rdquo; said she, triumphantly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That it did. The Duke went back to town fifteen years younger. No one
knew him; the Queen did not know him. And to this day he says, 'Whenever
I'm hipped or out of sorts, I know what a resource I have in the
Glengariff heather.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It is possible that Davenport Dunn listened with more of interest to this
little incident because the hero of it was a Duke and a Cabinet Minister.
</p>
<p>
Assuredly the minor ills of life, the petty stomachic miseries, and such
like, are borne with a more becoming patience when we know that they are
shared by peers and great folk. Not by <i>you</i>, valued reader, nor even
by <i>me</i>,&mdash;we have no such weaknesses,&mdash;but by the Davenport
Dunns of this world, one of whom we are now treating. It was pleasant,
too, to feel that he not only had a ducal ailment, but that he was to be
cured like his Grace! And so he listened eagerly, as Lady Augusta went on
to tell of the various localities, strange and unpronounceable, that they
used to visit, and how his Grace loved to row across such an arm of the
lake, and what delight he took in the ascent of such a mountain. &ldquo;But you
shall judge for yourself, Mr. Dunn,&rdquo; said she, smiling, &ldquo;and I now engage
you for to-morrow, after breakfast.&rdquo; And with that she rose, and,
accompanied by Sybella, passed into the drawing-room. Dunn was about to
follow, when Lord Glengariff called out, &ldquo;I'm of the old school, Dunn, and
must have half an hour with my bottle before I join the ladies.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
We do not stop to explain&mdash;perhaps we should not succeed to our
wishes if we tried&mdash;why it was that Dunn was more genial, better
satisfied, and more at his ease than when the dinner began; but so it was
that as he filled the one glass of claret be meant to indulge in, he felt
that he had been exaggerating to his own mind the disagreeables of this
visit, and that everybody was kinder, pleasanter, and more natural than he
had expected.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Jesting apart, Dunn,&rdquo; said his Lordship, &ldquo;Augusta is right. What you
require is rest,&mdash;perfect repose; never to read or write a letter for
three weeks, not look at a newspaper, nor receive a telegraphic despatch.
Let us try if Glengariff cannot set you up. The fact is, we can't spare
you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your opinion is too flattering by half, my Lord; but really, any one&mdash;I
mean any one whose views are honest, and whose intentions are upright&mdash;can
complete the work I have begun. There is no secret,&mdash;no mystery in
it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come, come, this is over-modest. We all know that your head alone could
carry on the vast number of these great schemes which are now in operation
amongst us. Could you really tell the exact number of companies of which
you are Director?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'm afraid to say that I could,&rdquo; said Dunn, smiling.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course you could n't. It is marvellous, downright marvellous, how you
get through it. You rise early, of course?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my Lord, at five, summer and winter; light my own fire, and sit down
to the desk till eight; by that time I have finished my correspondence on
business topics. I then take a cup of tea and a little dry toast. This is
my preparation for questions of politics, which usually occupy me till
eleven. From that hour till three I receive deputations,&mdash;heads of
companies, and such like. I then take my ride, weather permitting, and
usually contrive to call at the Lodge, till nigh dinner-hour. If alone, my
meal is a frugal one, and soon despatched; and then begins the real work
of the day. A short nap of twenty minutes refreshes me, and I address
myself with energy to my task. In these quiet hours, undisturbed and
uninterrupted,&mdash;for I admit none, not one, at such seasons,&mdash;my
mind is clear and unclouded, and I can work, without a sense of fatigue,
till past midnight; it has even happened that morning has broke upon me
without my being aware of it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No health, no constitution, could stand that, Dunn,&rdquo; said Lord
Glengariff, with a voice artfully modulated to imply deep interest.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Men are mere relays on the road of life; when one sinks, wearied or worn
out, a fresh one comes forth ready to take his place in the traces.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That may be&mdash;that may be, in the mass of cases; but there are
exceptional men, Dunn,&mdash;men who&mdash;men, in fact, whose faculties
have such an adaptiveness to the age we live in&mdash;do you perceive my
meaning?&mdash;men of the situation, as the French say.&rdquo; Here his Lordship
began to feel that he was getting upon very ticklish ground, and by no
means sure how he was to get safely back again, when, with a violent
plunge, he said, &ldquo;That fellow Washington was one of those men, Louis
Napoleon is another, and you&mdash;I don't hesitate to say it&mdash;you
are also an instance of what I mean.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Dunn's pale face flushed up as he muttered some broken words of
depreciating meaning.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The circumstances, I am aware, are different. You have not to
revolutionize a country, but you have undertaken just as hard a task: to
remodel its social state,&mdash;to construct out of the ruined materials
of a bankrupt people the elements of national wealth and greatness. Let no
man tell me, sir, that this is not a bolder effort than the other. Horse,
foot, and dragoons, as poor Grattan used to say, won't aid you here. To
your own clear head and your own keen intellect must you trust.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;My dear Lord,&rdquo; broke in Dunn, in a voice not devoid of emotion, &ldquo;you
exaggerate both my labor and my capacity. I saw that the holders of Irish
property were not the owners, and I determined that they should be so. I
saw that the people were improvident, less from choice than necessity, and
I gave them banks. I saw land unproductive for want of capital, and I
established the principle of loans for drainage and other improvements. I
perceived that our soil and our climate favor certain species of
cultivation, and as certainly deny some others. I popularized this
knowledge.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you call this nothing! Why, sir, where's the statesman can point to
such a list of legislative acts? Peel himself has left no such legacy
behind him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, my Lord, this is too flattering,&mdash;too flattering by half.&rdquo; And
Dunn sipped his wine and looked down. &ldquo;By the way, my Lord,&rdquo; said he,
after a pause, &ldquo;how has my recommendation in the person of Miss Kellett
succeeded?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A very remarkable young woman,&mdash;a singularly gifted person indeed,&rdquo;
 said the old Lord, pompously. &ldquo;Some of her ideas are tinctured, it is
true, with that canting philanthropy we are just now infected with,&mdash;that
tendency to discover all the virtue in rags and all the vice in purple;
but, with this abatement to her utility, I must say she possesses a very
high order of mind. She comes of a good family, doesn't she?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;None better. The Kelletts of Kellett's Court were equal to any gentry in
this county.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And left totally destitute?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A mere wreck of the property remains, and even that is so cumbered with
claims and so involved in law that I scarcely dare to say that they have
an acre they can call their own.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Poor girl! A hard case,&mdash;a very hard case. We like her much, Dunn.
My daughter finds her very companionable; her services, in a business
point of view, are inestimable. All those reports you have seen are hers,
all those drawings made by her hand.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am aware, my Lord, how much zeal and intelligence she has displayed,&rdquo;
 said Dunn, who had no desire to let the conversation glide into the great
Glengariff scheme, &ldquo;and I am also aware how gratefully she feels the
kindness she has met with under this roof.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That is as it should be, Dunn, and I am rejoiced to hear it. It is in no
spirit of self-praise I say it, but in simple justice,&mdash;we do&mdash;my
daughter and myself, both of us&mdash;do endeavor to make her feel that
her position is less that of dependant than&mdash;than&mdash;companion.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I should have expected nothing less from your Lordship nor Lady Augusta,&rdquo;
 said Dunn, gravely.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes; you knew Augusta formerly; you can appreciate her high-minded
and generous character, though I think she was a mere child when you saw
her first.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very young indeed, my Lord,&rdquo; said Dunn, coloring faintly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;She is exactly, however, what she then promised to be,&mdash;an Arden, a
genuine Arden, sir; no deceit, no double; frank, outspoken; too much so,
perhaps, for our age of mock courtesy, but a noble-hearted girl, and one
fit to adorn any station.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
There was an honest, earnest sincerity in the old Lord's manner that made
Dunn listen with respect to the sentiments be uttered, though in his heart
the epithet &ldquo;girl,&rdquo; as applied to Lady Augusta, seemed somewhat ill
chosen.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I see you take no wine, so that, if you have no objection, we'll join the
ladies.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your Lordship was good enough to tell me that I was to make myself
perfectly at home here; may I begin at once to avail myself of your
kindness, and say that for this evening I beg to retire early? I have a
number of letters to read, and some to answer.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Really, Lady Augusta will feel quite offended if you slight her
tea-table.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nay, my Lord. It is only for this evening, and I am sure you will make my
excuses becomingly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It shall be as you please,&rdquo; said the old Lord, with a rather stiff
courtesy.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thank you, my Lord; thank you. I assure you it is very rarely the
sacrifice to duty costs me so keenly. Goodnight.&rdquo;
 </p>

<h2>
CHAPTER XXXVII. &ldquo;A MAN IN REQUEST&rdquo;
 </h2>
<p>
The bountifully spread breakfast-table of the following morning was not
destined to be graced by Mr. Dunn's presence. A clerk had arrived early in
the morning with a mass of correspondence from Dublin, and a Government
messenger, armed with an ominous-looking red box, came post-haste about an
hour later, while a request for a cup of tea in his own room explained
that Mr. Dunn was not to make his appearance in public.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;This savors of downright slavery,&rdquo; said Lady Augusta, whose morning
toilette was admirably devised.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To me it savors of downright humbug,&rdquo; said Lord Glengariff, pettishly.
&ldquo;No one shall tell me that a man has not time to eat his meals like a
gentleman. A Secretary of State does n't give himself such airs. Why, I
protest, here comes another courier! what can this fellow be?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A messenger from the Home Office has just arrived for Mr. Dunn,&rdquo; said
Miss Kellett, entering the room.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Our little cottage is become like a house in Whitehall Gardens,&rdquo; said
Lord Glengariff, angrily. &ldquo;I have no doubt we ought to feel excessively
flattered by the notoriety the newspapers are certain to accord us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Dunn is more to be pitied than any of us,&rdquo; said Lady Augusta,
compassionately.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I suspect he'd not agree with you,&rdquo; said his Lordship, bitterly. &ldquo;I
rather opine that Mr. Dunn has another and a very different estimate of
his present position.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Such a life is certainly not enviable. Perhaps I'm wrong, though,&rdquo; said
she, quickly; &ldquo;Miss Kellett does not seem of <i>my</i> mind.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Sybella blushed slightly, and in some embarrassment said, &ldquo;Certain minds
find their best happiness in great labor; Mr. Dunn's may be one of these.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pulteney found time for a cast with the hounds, and Charles Fox had
leisure for his rubber of whist. It is these modern fellows have
introduced the notion that 'the House' is like a 'mill at Manchester.'
There goes one with his despatches,&rdquo; cried he, as a mounted messenger rode
off from the door. &ldquo;I 'd wager a trifle that if they never came to hand
the world would just jog on its course as pleasantly, and no one the worse
for the mishap.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;With Mr. Dunn's compliments, my Lord,&rdquo; said a servant, placing several
open letters on the table; &ldquo;he thought your Lordship would like to see the
latest news from the Crimea.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
While Lord Glengariff took out his spectacles, his face grew crimson, and
he seemed barely able to restrain a burst of passionate indignation. As
the servant closed the door, he could no longer contain himself, but broke
out: &ldquo;Just fancy their sending off these despatches to this fellow Dunn.
Here am I, an Irish peer, of as good blood and ancient family as any in my
country, and I might as well expect to hear Buckingham Palace was fitted
up for my town residence when next I went to London, as look for an
attention of this sort. If I had n't it here under my own eyes, and saw
the address, 'Davenport Dunn, Esq.,' 'on her Majesty's service,' I 'd say
flatly it was impossible.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;May I read some of them?&rdquo; asked Lady Augusta, wishing by any means to
arrest this torrent of angry attack.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, read away,&rdquo; cried he, laying down his spectacles. &ldquo;Miss Kellett,
too, may indulge her curiosity, if she has any, about the war.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have a dearer interest at stake there,&rdquo; said Sybella, blushing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I see little here we have not already read in the 'Times,'&rdquo; said Lady
Augusta, perusing the paper before her. &ldquo;The old story of rifle-pits,
sorties against working parties, the severity of the duty, and the badness
of the commissariat.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;This is interesting,&rdquo; broke in Sybella. &ldquo;It is an extract from a private
letter of some one high in command. It says: 'The discontent of our allies
increases every day; and as every post from France only repeats how
unpopular the war is in that country, I foresee that nothing short of some
great <i>fait d'armes</i>, in which the French shall have all the glory,
will induce the Imperial Government to continue the struggle. The
satisfaction felt in France at the attacks of the English journals on our
own army, its generalship, and its organization, are already wearing out,
and they look now for some higher stimulant to the national vanity.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who writes this?&rdquo; cried Lord Glengariff, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The name is not given,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;The despatch goes on merely to say,
'Your Lordship would do well to give these words the consideration they
seem to deserve.' But here again, 'the coolness of the Marshal increases,
and our intercourse is neither frank nor confidential.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;All this sounds badly,&rdquo; said Lord Glengariff. &ldquo;Our only progress would
seem to be in ill-will with our ally. I suppose the end of it will be, we
shall be left to continue the struggle alone.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Would that it were so!&rdquo; burst in Sybella. &ldquo;A great orator said t' other
day in the House, that coalitions were fatal; Englishmen never liked them.
He only spoke of those alliances where parties agree to merge their
differences and unite for some common object; but far more perilous are
the coalitions where nations combine, the very contest that they wage
being a field to evoke ancient rivalries and smouldering jealousies. I 'd
rather see our little army alone, with its face to the foe and its back to
the sea, than I 'd read of our entrance into Sebastopol side by side with
the legions of France.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The passionate enthusiasm of the moment had carried her away, and she grew
pale and heart-sick at her unwonted boldness as she finished.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I hope Mr. Dunn may be able to benefit by your opinions on strategy,&rdquo;
 said Lady Augusta, as she rose from the table.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What was it Lady Augusta said?&rdquo; cried Lord Glengariff, as she left the
room.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I scarcely heard her aright, my Lord,&rdquo; said Sybella, whose face was now
crimson.
</p>
<p>
It was the first moment in her life in which dependence had exposed her to
insult, and she could not collect her faculties, or know what to do.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;These things,&rdquo; said Lord Glengariff, pushing the despatches
contemptuously away, &ldquo;add nothing to our knowledge. That writer in the
'Times' gives us everything we want to know, and gives it better too. Send
them back to Dunn, and ascertain, if you can, when we are likely to see
him. I want him to come down to the bay; he ought to see the harbor and
the coast. Manage this, Miss Kellett,&mdash;not from me, of course, but in
your own way,&mdash;and let me know.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Lord Glengariff now left the room, and Sybella was once more deep in the
despatches.
</p>
<p>
Dry and guarded as they were,&mdash;formal, with all the stamp of official
accuracy,&mdash;they yet told of the greatest and grandest struggle of our
age. It was a true war of Titans, with the whole world for spectators. The
splendid heroism of our army seemed even eclipsed by the unbroken
endurance of daily hardship,&mdash;that stern and uncomplaining courage
that faced death in cold blood, and marched to the fatal trenches with the
steadfast tramp of a forlorn hope.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No conscript soldiers ever bore themselves thus,&rdquo; cried she, in ecstasy.
&ldquo;These are the traits of personal gallantry, not the disciplined bravery
that comes of the serried file and the roll of the drum.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
With all her anxieties for his fate, she gloried to think &ldquo;dear Jack&rdquo; was
there,&mdash;that he was bearing his share of their hardships, and reaping
his share of their glory. And oh! if she could but read mention of his
name; if she could hear of him quoted for some act of gallantry, or,
better still, some trait of humanity and kindness,&mdash;that he had
rescued a wounded comrade, or succored some poor maimed and forlorn enemy!
</p>
<p>
How hard was it for her on that morning, full of these themes, to address
herself to the daily routine of her work! The grand panorama of war
continued to unroll itself before her eyes, and the splendid spectacle of
the contending armies revealed itself like a picture before her. The
wondrous achievements she had read of reminded her of those old histories
which had been the delight of her childhood, and she gloried to think that
the English race was the same in daring and chivalry as it had shown
itself centuries back!
</p>
<p>
She tried hard to persuade herself that the peaceful triumphs of art, the
great discoveries of science, were finer and grander developments of human
nature; but with all her ingenuity they seemed inglorious and poor beside
the splendid displays of heroism.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And now to my task,&rdquo; said she, with a sigh, as she folded up the map of
the Crimea, on which she was tracing the events of the war.
</p>
<p>
Her work of that morning was the completion of a little &ldquo;Memoir&rdquo; of
Glengariff and its vicinity, written in that easy and popular style which
finds acceptance in our periodicals, and meant to draw attention to the
great scheme for whose accomplishment a company was to be formed. Lord
Glengariff wished this sketch should be completed while Dunn was still
there, so that it might be shown him, and his opinion be obtained upon it.
</p>
<p>
Never had her task seemed so difficult, never so uncongenial; and though
she labored hard to summon up all her former interest in the great
enterprise, her thoughts would stray away, in spite of her, to the
indented shores of the Crimea, and the wild and swelling plains around
Sebastopol. Determined to see if change of place might not effect some
change of thought, she carried her papers to a little summer-house on the
river-side, and once more addressed herself resolutely to her work. With
an energy that rarely failed her, she soon overcame the little
distraction, and wrote away rapidly and with ease. She at last reached
that stage in her essay where, having enumerated all the advantages of the
locality, she desired to show how nothing was wanting to complete its
celebrity and recognition but the touch of some of those great financial
magicians whose great privilege it is to develop the wealth and augment
the resources of their fellow-men. She dwelt earnestly and, indeed,
eloquently on the beauty of the scenery. She knew it in every varying
aspect of its coloring, and she lingered over a description of which the
reality had so often captivated her. Still, even here, the fostering hand
of taste might yet contribute much. The stone pine and the ilex would
blend favorably with the lighter foliage of the ash and the hazel, and
many a fine point of view was still all but inaccessible for want of a
footpath. How beautifully, too, would the tasteful cottage of some true
lover of the picturesque peep from amidst the evergreen oaks that grew
down to the very shore. While she wrote, a shadow fell over her paper. She
looked up, and saw Mr. Dunn. He had strolled by accident to the spot, and
entered unperceived by her.

<p>
&ldquo;What a charming place you have chosen for your study, Miss Kellett!&rdquo; said
he, seating himself at the table. &ldquo;Not but I believe,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;that
when once deeply engaged in a pursuit, one takes little account of
surrounding objects. Pastorals have been composed in garrets, and our
greatest romancer wrote some of his most thrilling scenes amid the noise
and commonplace interruptions of a Court of Sessions.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Such labors as mine,&rdquo; said she, smiling, &ldquo;neither require nor deserve the
benefit of a chosen spot.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are engaged upon Glengariff,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;am I at liberty to look?&rdquo; And
he took the paper from the table as he spoke. At first he glanced half
carelessly at the lines; but as he read on he became more attentive, and
at last, turning to the opening pages, he read with marked earnestness and
care.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have done this very well,&mdash;admirably well,&rdquo; said he, as he laid
it down; &ldquo;but shall I be forgiven if I make an ungracious speech?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Say on,&rdquo; said she, smiling good-naturedly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said he, drawing a long breath, &ldquo;you are pleading an
impossible cause. They who suggested it were moved by the success of those
great enterprises which every day develops around us, and which, by the
magic word 'Company,' assume vitality and consistence; they speculated on
immense profits just as they could compute a problem in arithmetic. It
demanded so much skill and no more. <i>You</i>&mdash;I have no need that
you should tell me so&mdash;were actuated by very different motives. You
wanted to benefit a poor and neglected peasantry, to disseminate amongst
them the blessings of comfort and civilization; <i>you</i> were eager for
the philanthropy of the project, <i>they</i> for its gain.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But why, as a mere speculation, should it be a failure?&rdquo; broke she in.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There are too many reasons for such a result,&rdquo; said he, with a melancholy
smile. &ldquo;Suffice it if I give you only one. We Irish are not in favor just
now. While we were troublesome and rebellious, there was an interest
attached to us,&mdash;we were dangerous; and even in the sarcasms of the
English press there lurked a secret terror of some great convulsion here
which should shake the entire empire. We are prosperous now, and no longer
picturesque. Our better fortune has robbed us of the two claims we used to
have on English sympathy; we are neither droll nor ragged, and so they can
neither laugh at our humor nor sneer at our wretchedness. Will not these
things show you that we are not likely to be fashionable? I say this to
you; to Lord Glengariff I will speak another language. I will tell him
that his scheme will not attract speculators. I myself cannot advocate it.
I never link my name with defeats. He will be, of course, indignant, and
we shall part on bad terms. He is not the first I have refused to make
rich.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
There was a tone of haughty assumption in the way he spoke these words
that astonished Sybella, who gazed at him without speaking.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you happy here?&rdquo; asked he, abruptly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;that is, I have been so up to this&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;In short, until I had robbed you of an illusion,&rdquo; said he, interrupting
her. &ldquo;Ah, how many a pang do these 'awakenings' cost us in life!&rdquo; muttered
he, half to himself. &ldquo;Every one has his ambitions of one sort or other,
and fancies his goal the true one; but, his faith once disturbed, how hard
it is to address himself earnestly to another creed!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If it be duty,&rdquo; broke she in, &ldquo;and if we have the consciousness of an
honest breast and a right intention&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That is to say, if we gain a verdict in the court where we ourselves sit
as judge,&rdquo; said he, with a suddenness that surprised her. &ldquo;I, for
instance, have my own sense of what is right and just; am I quite sure it
is <i>yours?</i> I see certain anomalies in our social condition, great
hardships, heavy wrongs; if I address myself to correct them, am I so
certain that others will concur with me? The battle of life, like every
other conflict, is one in which to sustain the true cause one must do many
a cruel thing. It is only at last, when success has crowned all your
efforts, that the world condescends to say you have done well.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You, of all men, can afford to await this judgment patiently.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why do you say that of <i>me?</i>&rdquo; asked he, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Because, so long as I can remember, I have seen your name associated with
objects of charity and benevolence; and not these alone, but with every
great enterprise that might stimulate the efforts and develop the
resources of the country.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Some might say that personal objects alone influenced me,&rdquo; said he, in a
low voice.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How poor and narrow-minded would be such a judgment!&rdquo; replied she,
warmly. &ldquo;There is an earnestness in high purpose no self-seeking could
ever counterfeit.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;That is true,&mdash;quite true,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but are you so certain that
the world makes the distinction? Does not the vulgar estimate confound the
philanthropist with the speculator? I say this with sorrow.&rdquo; said he,
painfully, &ldquo;for I myself am the victim of this very injustice.&rdquo; He paused
for a few seconds, and then rising, he said, &ldquo;Let us stroll along the
river-side; we have both worked enough for the day.&rdquo; She arose at once,
and followed him. &ldquo;It is ever an ungracious theme,&mdash;one's self,&rdquo; said
he, as they walked along; &ldquo;but, somehow, I am compelled to talk to you,
and, if you will allow me, confidentially.&rdquo; He did not wait for a reply,
but went on: &ldquo;There was, in the time of the French Regency, a man named
Law, who, by dint of deep study and much labor, arrived at the discovery
of a great financial scheme; so vast, so comprehensive, and so complete
was it, that not only was it able to rescue the condition of the State
from bankruptcy, but it disseminated through the trading-classes of the
nation the sound principles of credit on which alone commerce can be
based. Now, this man&mdash;a man of unquestionable genius and, if benefits
to one's species gave a just title to the name, a philanthropist&mdash;lived
to see the great discovery he had made prostituted to the basest arts of
scheming speculators. From the Prince, who was his patron, to the humblest
agent of the Bourse, he met nothing but duplicity, falsehood, and
treachery, and he ended in being driven in shame and ignominy from the
land he had succeeded in rescuing from impending rain! You will say that
the people and the age explain much of this base ingratitude; but, believe
me, nations and eras are wonderfully alike. The good and evil of this
world go on repeating themselves in cycles with a marvellous regularity.
The fate which befell Law may overtake any who will endeavor to imitate
him; there is but one condition which can avert this catastrophe, and that
is success. Law had too long deferred to provide for his own security. Too
much occupied with his grand problem, he had made himself neither rich nor
great, so that when the hour of adversity came no barriers of wealth or
power stood between him and his enemies. Had he foreseen this catastrophe,&mdash;had
he anticipated it,&mdash;he might have so dovetailed his own interests
with those of the State that attack upon one involved the fate of the
other. But Law did nothing of the kind; he made friends of Princes, and
with the fortune that attaches to such friendships, he fell!&rdquo; For some
minutes he walked along at her side without speaking, and then resumed:
&ldquo;With all these facts before me, I, too, see that Law's fate may be my
own!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But have you&mdash;&rdquo; When she had gone thus far, Sybella stopped, and
blushed deeply, unable to continue.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, answering what might have been her words,&mdash;&ldquo;yes, it
was my ambition to have been to Ireland what Law was to France,&mdash;not
what calumny and injustice have pictured him, remember, but the great
reformer, the great financier, the great philanthropist,&mdash;to make
this faction-torn land a great and united nation. To develop the resources
of the richest country in Europe was no mean ambition, and he who even
aspired to it was worthy of a better recompense than attack and insult.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have seen none of these,&rdquo; broke she in. &ldquo;Indeed, so long as I remember,
I can call to mind only eulogies of your zeal, praises of your
intelligence, and the grandeur of your designs.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There are such, however,&rdquo; said he, gloomily; &ldquo;they are the first low
murmurings, too, of a storm that will come in full force hereafter! Let it
come,&rdquo; muttered he, below his breath. &ldquo;If I am to fall, it shall be like
Samson, and the temple shall fall with me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Sybella did not catch his words, but the look of his features as he spoke
them made her almost shudder with terror.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let us turn back,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;it is growing late.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Without speaking, Dunn turned his steps towards the cottage, and walked
along in deep thought.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Hankes has come, sir,&rdquo; said Dunn's servant, as he reached the door.
And without even a word, Dunn hastened to his own room.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXXVIII. MR. DAVENPORT DUNN IN MORE MOODS THAN ONE
</h2>
<p>
Although Mr. Hankes performs no very conspicuous part in our story, he
makes his appearance at the Hermitage with a degree of pomp and
circumstance which demand mention. With our reader's kind leave,
therefore, we mean to devote a very brief chapter to that gentleman and
his visit.
</p>
<p>
As in great theatres there is a class of persons to whose peculiar skill
and ability are confided all the details of &ldquo;spectacle,&rdquo; all those grand
effects of panoramic splendor which in a measure make the action of the
drama subordinate to the charms of what, more properly, ought to be mere
accessories; so modern speculation has called to its aid its own special
machinists and decorators,&mdash;a gifted order of men, capable of
surrounding the dryest and least promising of enterprises with all the
pictorial attractions and attractive graces of the &ldquo;ballet&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
If it be a question of a harbor or dock company, the prospectus is headed
with a colored print, wherein tall three-deckers mingle with close-reefed
cutters, their gay buntings fluttering in the breeze as the light waves
dance around the bows; from the sea beneath to the clouds above, all is
motion and activity,&mdash;meet emblems of the busy shore where commerce
lives and thrives. If it be a building speculation, the architecture is
but the background of a brilliant &ldquo;mall,&rdquo; where splendid equipages and
caracoling riders figure, with gay parasols and sleek poodles intermixed.
</p>
<p>
One &ldquo;buys in&rdquo; to these stocks with feelings far above &ldquo;five percent.&rdquo; A
sense of the happiness diffused amongst thousands of our fellow-creatures&mdash;the
&ldquo;blessings of civilization,&rdquo; as we like to call the extension of cotton
prints&mdash;cheer and animate us; and while laying out our money
advantageously, we are crediting our hearts with a large balance on the
score of philanthropy. To foster this commendable tendency, to feed the
tastes of those who love, so to say, to &ldquo;shoot at Fortune with both
barrels,&rdquo; an order of men arose, cunning in all the devices of
advertisement, learned in the skill of capitals, and adroit in
illustrations.
</p>
<p>
Of these was Mr. Hankes. Originally brought up at the feet of George
Robins, he was imported into Ireland by Mr. Davenport Dunn as his chief
man at business,&mdash;the Grand Vizier of Joint Stock Companies and all
industrial speculations.
</p>
<p>
If Dr. Pangloss was a good man for knowing what wickedness was, Mr. Hankes
might equally pretend to skill in all enterprises, since he had
experienced, for a number of years, every species of failure and defeat
The description of his residences would fill half a column of a newspaper.
They ranged from Brompton to Boulogne, and took in everything from Wilton
Crescent to St John's Wood. He had done a little of everything, too, from
&ldquo;Chief Commissioner to the Isthmus&rdquo;&mdash;we never heard of what isthmus&mdash;to
Parliamentary Agent for the friends of Jewish emancipation. With a
quickness that rarely deceived him, Dunn saw his capabilities. He regarded
him as fighting fortune so bravely with all the odds against him, that he
ventured to calculate what such a man might be, if favorably placed in the
world. The fellow who could bring down his bird with a battered old flint
musket might reasonably enough distinguish himself if armed with an
Enfield rifle. The venture was not, however, entirely successful; for
though Hankes proved himself a very clever fellow, he was only really
great under difficulties. It was with the crash of falling fortunes around
him&mdash;amidst debt, bankruptcy, executions, writs, and arrests&mdash;Hankes
rose above his fellows, and displayed all the varied resources of his
fertile genius. The Spartan vigor of his mind assorted but badly with
prosperity, and Hankes waxed fat and indolent, affected gorgeous
waistcoats and chains, and imperceptibly sank down to the level of those
decorative arts we have just alluded to.
</p>
<p>
The change was curious: it was as though Gerard or Gordon Cumming should
have given up lion-hunting and taken to teach piping bullfinches!
</p>
<p>
Every venture of Davenport Dunn was prosperous. All his argosies were
borne on favoring winds, and Hankes saw his great defensive armor hung up
to rust and to rot. Driven in some measure, therefore, to cut out his path
in life, he invented that grand and gorgeous school of enterprise whose
rashness and splendor crush into insignificance all the puny attempts of
commonplace speculators. He only talked millions; thousands he ignored. He
would accept of no names on the direction of his schemes save the very
highest in rank. If he crossed the Channel, his haste required a special
steamer. If he went by rail, a special train awaited him. The ordinary
world, moving along at its tortoise pace, was shocked at the meteor course
that every now and then shot across the hemisphere, and felt humiliated in
their own hearts by the comparison.
</p>
<p>
Four smoking posters, harnessed to the neatest and lightest of
travelling-carriages, had just deposited Mr. Hankes at the Hermitage; and
he now sat in Mr. Dunn's dressing-room, arranging papers and assorting
documents in preparation for his arrival.
</p>
<p>
It was easy to perceive that as Dunn entered the room he was very far from
feeling pleased at his lieutenant's presence there.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What was there so very pressing, Mr. Hankes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that could not
have awaited my return to town?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A stormy meeting of the Lough Allen Tin Company yesterday, sir,&mdash;a
very stormy meeting indeed. Shares down to twenty-seven and an eighth,&mdash;unfavorable
report on the ore, and a rumor&mdash;mere rumor, of course&mdash;that the
last dividend was paid out of capital.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who says this?&rdquo; asked Dunn, angrily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The 'True Blue,' sir, hinted as much in the evening edition, and the
suggestion was at once caught up by the Tory Press.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Macken&mdash;isn't that the man's name&mdash;edits the 'True Blue'?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir; Michael Macken.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What answer shall I give him, then?&rdquo; asked Hankes.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Tell him&mdash;explain to him that the exigencies of party&mdash;No, that
won't do. Send down Harte to conduct his election, let him be returned for
the borough, and tell Joe Harte to take care to provide a case that will
unseat him on a petition; before the petition comes on, we shall have the
sale completed. The Colonel shall be taught that our tactics are somewhat
sharper than his own.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Hankes smiled approvingly at this stratagem of his chief, and really for
the moment felt proud of serving such a leader. Once more, however, did he
turn to his dreary note-book and its inexorable bead-roll of difficulties;
but Dunn no longer heard him, for he was deep in his private
correspondence, tearing open and reading letter after letter with
impatient haste. &ldquo;What of the Crimea&mdash;what did you say, there?&rdquo; cried
Dunn, stopping suddenly, and catching at the sound of that one word.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That report of the 'Morning Post' would require a prompt contradiction.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What report?&rdquo; asked Dunn, quickly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here's the paragraph.&rdquo; And the other read from a newspaper before him:
&ldquo;'Our readers, we feel assured, will learn with satisfaction that the
Government is at this moment in negotiation for the services of Mr.
Davenport Dunn in the Crimea. To any one who has followed the sad story of
our Commissariat blunders and shortcomings, the employment of this&mdash;the
first administrative mind of our day&mdash;will be matter for just
gratification. We have only to turn our eyes to the sister country, and
see what success has attended his great exertions there, to anticipate
what will follow his labors in the still more rugged field of the Crimea.'
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;This is from the 'Examiner': 'We are sorry to hear, and upon the
authority that assumes to be indisputable, that a grave difficulty has
suspended, for the time at least, the negotiation between the Government
and Mr. Daren-port Dunn; the insistence on the part of that gentleman of
such a recognition for his services as no Administration could dare to
promise being the obstacle.'
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;'Punch' has also his say: 'Mr. Davenport Dunn's scheme is now before the
cabinet It resolves itself into this: The Anglo-French alliance to be
conducted on the principles of a Limited Liability Company. For preference
shares, address Count Morny in Paris, or Dowb at Balaklava.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So much for official secrecy and discretion. This morning brings me the
offer from the Minister of this appointment; and here is the whole press
of England speculating, criticising, and ridiculing it, forty-eight hours
before the proposal is made me! What says the great leading journal?&rdquo;
 added he, opening a broad sheet before him. &ldquo;Very brief, and very vague,&rdquo;
 muttered he. &ldquo;'No one knows better than the accomplished individual
alluded to, how little the highest honors in the power of the Crown to
bestow could add to the efficiency of that zeal, or the purpose of that
guidance he has so strenuously and successfully devoted to the advancement
of his country.' Psha!&rdquo; cried he, angrily, as he threw down the paper, and
walked to the window.
</p>
<p>
Hankes proceeded to read aloud one of those glowing panegyrics certain
popular journals loved to indulge in, on the superior virtue, capacity,
and attainments of the middle classes. &ldquo;Of these,&rdquo; said the writer, &ldquo;Mr.
Dunn is a good specimen. Sprung from what may be called the very humblest
rank&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who writes that? What paper is it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The 'Daily Tidings.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You affect to know all these fellows of the press. It is your pride to
have been their associate and boon companion. I charge you, then, no
matter for the means or the cost, get that man discharged; follow him up
too; have an eye upon him wherever he goes, and wherever he obtains
employment. He shall learn that a hungry stomach is a sorry recompense for
the pleasure of pointing a paragraph. Let me see that you make a note of
this, Mr. Hankes, and that you execute it also.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It was something so new for Hankes to see Dunn manifest any the slightest
emotion on the score of the press, whether its comments took the shape of
praise or blame, that he actually stared at him with a sort of incredulous
astonishment.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If I were born a Frenchman, an Italian, or even a German,&rdquo; said Dunn,
with a savage energy of voice, &ldquo;should I be taunted in the midst of my
labors that my origin was plebeian? Would the society in which I move be
reminded that they accept me on sufferance? Would the cheer that greeted
my success be mingled with the cry, 'Remember whence you came'? I tell
you, sir,&rdquo; and here he spoke with the thickened utterance of intense
passion,&mdash;&ldquo;I tell you, sir, that with all the boasted liberty of our
institutions, we cultivate a social slavery in these islands, to which the
life of a negro is freedom in comparison!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A sharp tap at the door interrupted him, and he cried, &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo; It was a
servant to say dinner was on the table, and his Lordship was waiting.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Please to say I am indisposed,&mdash;a severe headache. I hope his
Lordship will excuse my not appearing to-day,&rdquo; said he, with evident
confusion; and then, when the servant withdrew, added: &ldquo;You may go down to
the inn. I suppose there is one in the village. I shall want horses
to-morrow, and relays ready on the road to Killarney. Give the orders, and
if anything else occurs to my recollection, I 'll send you word in the
evening.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Whether it was that Mr. Hankes had been speculating on the possible
chances of dining with &ldquo;my Lord&rdquo; himself, or that the prospect of the inn
at Glengariff was little to his taste, but he assuredly gathered up his
papers in a mood that indicated no peculiar satisfaction, and withdrew
without a word.
</p>
<p>
A second message now came to inquire what Mr. Dunn would like to take for
his dinner, and conveying Lord Glengariffs regrets for his indisposition.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A little soup&mdash;some fish, if there be any&mdash;nothing else,&rdquo; said
Dunn, while he opened his writing-desk and prepared for work. Not noticing
the interruption of the servant as he laid the table, he wrote away
rapidly; at last he arose, and, having eaten a few mouthfuls, reseated
himself at his desk. His letter was to the Minister, in answer to the
offer of that morning's post. There was a degree of dexterity in the way
that he conveyed his refusal, accompanying it by certain suggestive hints,
vague and shadowy of course, of what the services of such a man as himself
might possibly accomplish, so as to indicate how great was the loss to the
State by not being fortunate enough to secure such high acquirements. The
whole wound up with a half-ambiguous regret that, while the Ministry
should accept newspaper dictation for their appointments, they could not
also perceive that popular will should be consulted in the rewards
extended to those who deserted their private and personal objects to
devote their energies to the cause of the empire.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Whenever such a Government shall arise,&rdquo; wrote he, &ldquo;the Ministry will
find few refusals to the offers of employment, and men will alike consult
their patriotism and their self-esteem in taking office under the Crown;
nor will there be found, in the record of replies to a Ministerial
proffer, one such letter as now bears the signature of your Lordship's
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very devoted and very obedient servant,
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Davenport Dunn.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This history does not profess to say how Mr. Dunn's apology was received
by his noble host. Perhaps, however, we are not unwarranted in supposing
that Lord Glengariffs temper was sorely and severely tested; one thing is
certain, the dinner passed off with scarcely a word uttered at the table,
and a perfect stillness prevailed throughout the cottage.
</p>
<p>
After some hours of hard labor, Dunn opened his window to enjoy the fresh
air of the night, tempered slightly as it was with a gentle sea-breeze. If
our western moonlights have not the silver lustre of Greece, of which old
Homer himself sings, they have, in compensation, a mellow radiance of
wondrous softness and beauty. Objects are less sharply defined and picked
out, it is true, but the picture gains in warmth of color, and those
blended effects where light and shadow alternate. The influences of Nature&mdash;the
calm, still moonlight; the measured march of the long, sweeping waves upon
the strand; those brilliant stars, &ldquo;so still above, so restless in the
water&rdquo;&mdash;have a marvellous power over the hard-worked men of the
world. They are amidst the few appeals to the heart which they can neither
spurn nor reject.
</p>
<p>
Half hidden by the trees, but still visible from where he sat, Dunn could
mark the little window of his humble bedroom twenty years ago! Ay! there
was the little den to which he crept at night, his heart full of many a
sorrow; the &ldquo;proud man's contumely&rdquo; had eaten deep into him, and each day
brought some new grievance, some new trial to be endured, while the sight
of her he loved&mdash;the young and haughty girl&mdash;goaded him almost
to madness.
</p>
<p>
One after another came all the little incidents of that long-forgotten
time crowding to his memory; and now he bethought him how noiselessly he
used to glide down those stairs, and, stealing into the wood, meet her in
her morning's walk, and how, as with uncovered head, he bowed to her, she
would bestow upon him one of her own half-saucy smiles,&mdash;more mockery
than kindness. He called to mind the day, too, he had climbed the mountain
to gather a bouquet of the purple heath,&mdash;she said she liked it,&mdash;and
how, after a great effort of courage, he ventured to offer it to her. She
took it half laughingly from his hand, and then, turning to her pet goat
beside her, gave it him to eat. He could have shot himself that morning,
and yet there he was now, to smile over the incident!
</p>
<p>
As he sat, the sounds of music floated up from the open window of the room
beneath. It was the piano, the same he used to hear long ago, when the
Poet himself of the Melodies came down to pass a few days at the
Hermitage. A low, soft voice was now singing, and as he bent down he could
hear the words of poor Griffin's beautiful song:&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;A place in thy memory, dearest,
Is all that I claim;
To pause and look back as thou nearest
The sound of my name.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
What a strange thrill did the words send through him! They came, as it
were, to fill up the whole story of the past, embodying the unspoken
prayer his love-sick heart once was filled with. For that &ldquo;smile and kind
word when we meet,&rdquo; had he once pined and longed, and where was the spirit
now that had once so yearned for love? A cold shudder passed over him, and
he felt ill. He sat for a long while so deep in reflection that he did not
notice the music had ceased, and now all was still and silent around. From
the balcony outside his window a little winding stair led down to the lawn
beneath; and down this he now took his way, resolving to stroll for half
an hour or so before bedtime.
</p>
<p>
Walking carelessly along, he at last found himself on the banks of the
river, close to the spot where he had met Miss Kellett that same morning.
How glad he would have been to find her there again! That long morning's
ramble had filled him with many a hopeful thought&mdash;he knew, with the
instinct that in such men as himself rarely deceives&mdash;that he had
inspired her with a sort of interest in him, and it warmed his self-esteem
to think that he could be valued for something besides &ldquo;success.&rdquo; The
flutter of a white dress crossing the little rustic bridge caught his eye
at this moment, and he hurried along the path. He soon gained sufficiently
upon the retiring figure to see it was a lady. She was strolling quietly
along, stopping at times to catch the effects of the moonlight on the
landscape.
</p>
<p>
Dunn walked so as to make his footsteps heard approaching, and she turned
suddenly and exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Dunn, who would have thought to see you
here?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A question I might almost have the hardihood to retort, Lady Augusta,&rdquo;
 said he, completely taken by surprise.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;As for me,&rdquo; said she, carelessly, &ldquo;it is my usual walk every evening. I
stroll down to the shore round by that rocky headland, and rarely return
before midnight; but <i>you,</i>&rdquo; added she, throwing a livelier interest
into her tone, &ldquo;they said you were poorly, and so overwhelmed with
business it was hopeless to expect to see you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Work follows such men as myself like a destiny,&rdquo; said he, sighing; &ldquo;and
as the gambler goes on to wager stake after stake on fortune, so do we
hazard leisure, taste, happiness, all, to gain&mdash;I know not what in
the end.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your simile points to the losing gamester,&rdquo; said she, quickly; &ldquo;but he
who has won, and won largely, may surely quit the table when he pleases.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said he, after a pause,&mdash;&ldquo;it is true, I have had luck
with me. The very trees under whose branches we are walking, could they
but speak, might bear witness to a time when I strolled here as poor and
as hopeless as the meanest outcast that walks the high-road. I had not one
living soul to say, 'Be of good cheer, your time will come yet.' My case
had even more than the ordinary obstacles to success; for fate had placed
me where every day, every hour of my life, should show me the disparity
between myself and those high-born great to whose station I aspired. If
you only knew, Lady Augusta,&rdquo; added he, in a tone tremulous with emotion,
&ldquo;what store I laid on any passing kindness,&mdash;the simplest word, the
merest look,&mdash;how even a gesture or a glance lighted hope within my
heart, or made it cold and dreary within me, you 'd wonder that a creature
such as this could nerve itself to the stern work of life.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was but a child at the time you speak of,&rdquo; said she, looking down
bashfully; &ldquo;but I remember you perfectly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said he, with an accent that implied pleasure.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So well,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;that there is not a spot in the wood where we
used to take our lesson-books in summer, but lives still associated in my
mind with those hours, so happy they were!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I always feared that I had left very different memories behind me here,&rdquo;
 said he, in a low voice.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You were unjust, then,&rdquo; said she, in a tone still lower,&mdash;&ldquo;unjust to
yourself and to us.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
They walked on without speaking, a strange mysterious consciousness that
each was in the other's thoughts standing in place of converse between
them. At length, stopping suddenly in front of a little rocky cavern, over
which aquatic plants were drooped, she said, &ldquo;Do you remember calling that
'Calypso's grotto'? It bears no other name still.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I remember more,&rdquo; said he; and then stopped in some confusion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Some girlish folly of mine, perhaps,&rdquo; broke she in hurriedly; &ldquo;but once
for all, let me ask forgiveness for many a thoughtless word, many a
childish wrong. You, who know all tempers and moods of men as few know
them, can well make allowances for natures spoiled as ours were,&mdash;pampered
and flattered by those about us, living in a little world of our own here.
And yet, do not think me silly when I own that I would it were all back
again. The childish wrong. You, who know all tempers and moods of men as
few know them, can well make allowances for natures spoiled as ours were&mdash;pampered
and nattered by those about us, living in a little world of our own here.
And yet, do not think me silly when I own that I would it were all back
again. The childhood and the lessons, ay, the dreary Telemachus, that gave
me many a headache, and the tiresome hours at the piano, and the rest of
it.&rdquo; She glanced a covert glance at Dunn, and saw that his features were a
shade darker and gloomier than before. &ldquo;Mind,&rdquo; said she, quickly, &ldquo;I don't
ask you to join in this wish. You have lived to achieve great successes&mdash;to
be courted, and sought after, and caressed. I don't expect you to care to
live over again hours which perhaps you look back to with a sort of
horror.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I dare not well tell you how I look back to them,&rdquo; said he, in a
half-irresolute manner.
</p>
<p>
Had there been any to mark it, he would have seen that her cheek flushed
and her dark eyes grew darker as he spoke these words. She was far too
skilful a tactician to disturb, even by a syllable, the thoughts she knew
his words indicated; and again they sauntered along in silence, till they
found themselves standing on the shore of the sea.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How is it that the sea, like the sky, seems ever to inspire the wish that
says, 'What lies beyond that?'&rdquo; said Dunn, dreamily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It comes of that longing, perhaps, for some imaginary existence out of
the life of daily care and struggle&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I believe so,&rdquo; said he, interrupting. &ldquo;One is so apt to forget that
another horizon is sure to rise to view,&mdash;another bourne to be
passed!&rdquo; Then suddenly, as if with a rapid change of thought, he said,
&ldquo;What a charming spot this is to pass one's days in,&mdash;so calm, so
peaceful, so undisturbed!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I love it!&rdquo; said she, in a low, murmuring voice, as though speaking to
herself.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And I could love it too,&rdquo; said he, ardently, &ldquo;if fortune would but leave
me to a life of repose and quiet.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is so strange to hear men like yourself&mdash;men who in a measure
make their own fate,&mdash;always accuse Destiny. Who is there, let me
ask,&rdquo; said she, with a boldness the stronger that she saw an influence
followed her words,&mdash;&ldquo;who is there who could with more of graceful
pride retire from the busy cares of life than he who has worked so long,
so successfully, for his fellow-men? Who is there who, having achieved
fortune, friends, station&mdash;Why do you shake your head?&rdquo; cried she,
suddenly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You estimate my position too flatteringly, Lady Augusta,&rdquo; said he,
slowly, and like one laboring with some painful reflection. &ldquo;Of fortune&mdash;if
that mean wealth&mdash;I have more than I need. Friends&mdash;what the
world calls such&mdash;I suppose I may safely say I possess my share of.
But as to station, by which I would imply the rank which stamps a certain
grade in society, and carries with it a prestige&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is your own whenever you care to demand it,&rdquo; broke she in. &ldquo;It is not
when the soldier mounts the breach that his country showers its honours on
him&mdash;it is when, victory achieved, he comes back great and
triumphant. You have but to declare that your labours are completed, your
campaign finished, to meet any, the proudest, recognition your services
could claim. You know my father,&rdquo; said she, suddenly changing her voice to
a tone at once confidential and intimate&mdash;&ldquo;you know how
instinctively, as it were, he surrounds himself with all the prejudices of
his order. Well, even he, as late as last night, said to me, 'Dunn ought
to be one of us, Augusta. We want men of his stamp. The lawyers overbear
us just now. It is men of wider sympathies lets technical less narrowed,
that we need. He ought to be one of us.' Knowing what a great admission
that was for one like him, I ventured to ask how this was to be
accomplished. 'Ministers are often the last to ratify the judgment the
public' he pronounced.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, and what said you to that,&rdquo; asked Dunn, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let him only open his mind to Lady Augusta,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;If he but have
the will I promise to show him the way.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Dunn uttered no reply, but with bent-down head walked along, deep in
thought.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;May I ask you to lend me your arm, Mr. Dunn?&rdquo; said Lady Augusta, in her
gentlest of voices; and Dunn's heart beat with a strange, proud
significance as he gave it.
</p>
<p>
They spoke but little as they returned to the cottage.

<h2>
CHAPTER XXXIX. &ldquo;A LETTER TO JACK&rdquo;
 </h2>
<p>
Long after the other inhabitants of the Hermitage were fast locked in
sleep, Sybella Kellett sat at her writing-desk. It was the time&mdash;the
only time&mdash;she called her own, and she was devoting it to a letter to
her brother. Mr. Dunn had told her on that morning that an opportunity
offered to send anything she might have for him, and she had arranged a
little packet&mdash;some few things, mostly worked by her own hands&mdash;for
the poor soldier in the Crimea.
</p>
<p>
As one by one she placed the humble articles in the box, her tears fell
upon them&mdash;tears half pleasure and half sorrow&mdash;for she thought
how &ldquo;poor dear Jack&rdquo; would feel as each new object came before him,
reminding him of some thoughtful care, some anticipation of this or that
casualty; and when at last all seemed packed and nothing forgotten, she
arose and crossed the room towards a little shelf, from which she took a
small volume, and, kissing it twice fervently, laid it in the box. This
done, she knelt down, and with her head between her hands, close pressed
and hidden, prayed long and fervently. If her features wore a look of
sadness as she arose, it was of sadness not without hope; indeed, her face
was like one of those fair Madonnas which Raphael has left us,&mdash;faces
where trustfulness is more eminently the characteristic than any other
quality.
</p>
<p>
Her long letter was nearly completed, and she sat down to add the last
lines to it. It had grown into a sort of Journal of her daily life, its
cares and occupations, and she was half shocked at the length to which it
extended. &ldquo;I am not,&rdquo; wrote she, &ldquo;so unreasonable as to ask you to write
as I have done, but it would be an unspeakable pleasure if you would let
me give the public some short extracts from the letters you send me, they
are so unlike those our papers teem with. The tone of complaint is, I
know, the popular one. Some clever correspondents have struck the key-note
with success, and the public only listen with eagerness where the tale is
of sufferings which might have been spared, and hardships that need not
have been borne. But you, dear Jack, have taken another view of events,
and one which, I own, pleases me infinitely more. You say truly, besides,
that these narratives, interesting as no doubt they are to all at home
here, exercise a baneful influence on the military spirit of our army. Men
grow to care too much for newspaper distinction, too little for that noble
<i>esprit de camaraderie</i> which is the finest enthusiasm of the
service. I could not help feeling as if I heard your voice as I read, 'I
wish they would n't go on telling us about muddy roads, raw coffee, wet
canvas, and short rations; we don't talk of these things so much amongst
ourselves; we came out here to thrash the Russians, and none of us ever
dreamed it was to be done without rough usage.' What you add about the
evil effects of the soldier appealing to the civilian public for any
redress of his grievances, real or imaginary, is perfectly correct. It is
a great mistake.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You must forgive my having shown your last letter to Mr. Davenport Dunn,
who cordially joins me in desiring that you will let me send it to the
papers. He remarks truly, that the Irish temperament of making the
ludicrous repay the disagreeable is wanting in all this controversy, and
that the public mind would experience a great relief if one writer would
come forth to show that the bivouac fire is not wanting in pleasant
stories, nor even the wet night in the trenches without its burst of
light-hearted gayety.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Dunn fully approves of your determination not to 'purchase.' It would
be too hard if you could not obtain your promotion from the ranks after
such services as yours; so he says, and so, I suppose, I ought to concur
with him; but as this seven hundred pounds lies sleeping at the banker's
while your hard life goes on, I own I half doubt if he be right. I say
this to show you, once for all, that I will accept nothing of it I am
provided for amply, and I meet with a kindness and consideration for which
I was quite unprepared. Of course, I endeavor to make my services requite
this treatment, and do my best to merit the good-will shown me.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I often wonder, dear Jack, when we are to meet, and where. Two more
isolated creatures there can scarcely be on earth than ourselves, and we
ought, at least, to cling to each other. Not but I feel that, in thus
struggling alone with fortune, we are storing up knowledge of ourselves,
and experiences of life that will serve us hereafter. When I read in your
letters how by many a little trait of character you can endear yourself to
your poor comrades, softening the hardship of their lot by charms and
graces acquired in another sphere from theirs, I feel doubly strong in
going forth amongst the poor families of our neighborhood, and doubly
hopeful that even I may carry my share of comfort to some poorer and more
neglected.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The last object I have placed in your box, dearest Jack,&mdash;it will be
the first to reach your hands,&mdash;is my prayer-book. You have often
held it with me, long, long ago! Oh, if I dared to wish, it would be for
that time again, when we were children, with one heart between us. Let us
pray, my dear brother, that we may live to meet and be happy as we then
were; but if that is not to be,&mdash;if one be destined to remain alone a
wanderer here,&mdash;pray, my dearest brother, that the lot fall not to
me, who am weak-hearted and dependent.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The day is already beginning to break, and I must close this. My
heartfelt prayer and blessings go with it over the seas. Again and again,
God bless you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Why was it that still she could not seal that letter, but sat gazing sadly
on it, while at times she turned to the open pages of poor Jack's last
epistle to her?

<h2>
CHAPTER XL. SCHEMES AND PROJECTS
</h2>
<p>
The post-horses ordered for Mr. Dunn's carriage arrived, duly, at break of
day; but from some change of purpose, of whose motive this veracious
history can offer no explanation, that gentleman did not take his
departure, but merely despatched a messenger to desire Mr. Hankes would
come over to the Hermitage.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I shall remain here to-day, Hankes,&rdquo; said he, carelessly, &ldquo;and not
impossibly to-morrow also. There's something in the air here suits me, and
I have not felt quite well latterly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mr. Hankes bowed; but not even his long-practised reserve could conceal
the surprise he felt at this allusion to health or well-being. Positive
illness he could understand,&mdash;a fever or a broken leg were
intelligible ills; but the slighter casualties of passing indispositions
were weaknesses that he could not imagine a business mind could descend
to, no more than he could fancy a man's being turned from pursuing his
course because some one had accidentally jostled him in the streets.
</p>
<p>
Dunn was too acute a reader of men's thoughts not to perceive the
impression his words had produced; but with the indifference he ever
bestowed upon inferiors, he went on:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Forward my letters here till you hear from me; there's nothing so very
pressing at this moment that cannot wait my return to town. Stay&mdash;I
was to have had a dinner on Saturday; you'll have to put them off. Clowes
will show you the list; and let some of the evening papers mention my
being unavoidably detained in the south,&mdash;say nothing about
indisposition.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course not, sir,&rdquo; said Hankes, quite shocked at such an indiscretion
being deemed possible.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And why, 'of course,' Mr. Hankes?&rdquo; said Dunn, slowly. &ldquo;I never knew it
was amongst the prerogatives of active minds to be exempt from ailment.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A bad thing to speak about, sir,&mdash;a very bad thing, indeed,&rdquo; said
Hankes, solemnly. &ldquo;You constantly hear people remark, 'He was never the
same man since that last attack.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Psha!&rdquo; said Dunn, contemptuously.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I assure you, sir, I speak the sense of the community. The old adage
says, 'Two removes are as bad as a fire,' and in the same spirit I would
say, 'Two gouty seizures are equal to a retirement'.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Absurdity!&rdquo; said Dunn, angrily. &ldquo;I never have acknowledged&mdash;I never
will acknowledge&mdash;any such accountability to the world.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They bring us 'to book' whether we will or not,&rdquo; said Hankes, sturdily.
</p>
<p>
Dunn started at the words, and turned away to hide his face; and well was
it he did so, for it was pale as ashes, even to the lips, which were
actually livid.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You may expect me by Sunday morning, Hankes,&rdquo;&mdash;he spoke without
turning round,&mdash;&ldquo;and let me have the balance-sheet of the Ossory Bank
to look over. We must make no more advances to the gentry down there; we
must restrict our discounts.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Impossible, sir, impossible! There must be no discontent&mdash;for the
present, at least,&rdquo; said Hankes; and his voice sunk to a whisper.
</p>
<p>
Dunn wheeled round till he stood full before him, and thus they remained
for several seconds, each staring steadfastly at the other.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You don't mean to say, Hankes&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I do, sir,&rdquo; said the other, slowly, &ldquo;and I say it advisedly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then there must be some gross mismanagement, sir,&rdquo; said Dunn, haughtily.
&ldquo;This must be looked to! Except that loan of forty-seven thousand pounds
to Lord Lacking-ton, secured by mortgage on the estate it went to
purchase, with what has this Bank supplied us?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Remember, sir,&rdquo; whispered Hankes, cautiously glancing around the room as
he spoke, &ldquo;the loan to the Viscount was advanced by ourselves at six per
cent, and the estate was bought in under your own name; so that, in fact,
it is to us the Bank have to look as their security.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And am I not sufficient for such an amount, Mr. Hankes?&rdquo; said he,
sneeringly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I trust you are, sir, and for ten times the sum. Time is everything in
these affairs. The ship that would float over the bar at high water would
stick fast at half-flood.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The 'Time' I am anxious for is a very different one,&rdquo; said Dunn,
reflectively. &ldquo;It is the time when I shall no longer be harassed with
these anxieties. Life is not worth the name when it excludes the thought
of all enjoyment.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Business is business, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Hankes, with all the solemnity with
which such men deliver platitudes as wisdom.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Call it slavery, and you 'll be nearer the mark,&rdquo; broke in Dunn. &ldquo;For
what or for whom, let me ask you, do I undergo all this laborious toil?
For a world that at the first check or stumble will overwhelm me with
slanders. Let me but afford them a pretext, and they will debit me with
every disaster their own recklessness has caused, and forget to credit me
with all the blessings my wearisome life has conferred upon them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The way of the world, sir,&rdquo; sighed Hankes, with the same stereotyped
philosophy.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I know well,&rdquo; continued Dunn, not heeding the other's commonplace, &ldquo;that
there are men who would utilize the station which I have acquired; they'd
soon convert into sterling capital the unprofitable gains that I am
content with. They 'd be cabinet ministers, peers, ambassadors, colonial
governors. It's only men like myself work without wages.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;'The laborer is worthy of his hire,' says the old proverb.&rdquo; Mr. Hankes
was not aware of the authority, but quoted what he believed a popular
saying.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Others there are,&rdquo; continued Dunn, still deep in his own thoughts, &ldquo;that
would consult their own ease, and, throwing off this drudgery, devote what
remained to them of life to the calm enjoyments of a home.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mr. Hankes was disposed to add, &ldquo;Home, sweet home;&rdquo; but he coughed down
the impulse, and was silent.
</p>
<p>
Dunn walked the room with his arms crossed on his breast and his head bent
down, deep in his own reflections, while his lips moved, as if speaking to
himself. Meanwhile Mr. Hankes busied himself gathering together his
papers, preparatory to departure.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They 've taken that fellow Redlines. I suppose you 've heard it?&rdquo; said
he, still sorting and arranging the letters.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Dunn, stopping suddenly in his walk; &ldquo;where was he
apprehended?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;In Liverpool. He was to have sailed in the 'Persia,' and had his place
taken as a German watchmaker going to Boston.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What was it he did? I forget,&rdquo; said Dunn, carelessly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He did, as one may say, a little of everything; issued false scrip on the
Great Coast Railway, sold and pocketed the price of some thirty thousand
pounds' worth of their plant, mortgaged their securities, and cooked their
annual accounts so cleverly that for four years nobody had the slightest
suspicion of any mischief.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What was it attracted the first attention to these frauds, Hankes?&rdquo; said
Dunn, apparently curious to hear an interesting story.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The merest accident in the world. He had sent a few lines to the Duke of
Wycombe to inquire the character and capacity of a French cook. Pollard,
the Duke's man of business, happened to be in the room when the note came,
and his Grace begged he would answer it for him. Pollard, as you are
aware, is Chairman of the Coast Line; and when he saw the name 'Lionel
Redlines,' he was off in a jiffy to the Board room with the news.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;One would have thought a little foresight might have saved him from such
a stupid mistake as this,&rdquo; said Dunn, gravely. &ldquo;A mode of living so
disproportioned to his well-known means must inevitably have elicited
remark.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;At any other moment, so it would,&rdquo; said Hankes; &ldquo;but we live in a
gambling age, and no one can say where, when, the remedy be curative or
poisonous.&rdquo; Then, with a quick start round, he said, &ldquo;Hankes, do you
remember that terrific accident which occurred a few years ago in France,&mdash;at
Angers, I think the place was called? A regiment in marching order had to
cross a suspension-bridge, and coming on with the measured tramp of the
march, the united force was too much for the strength of the structure;
the iron beams gave way, and all were precipitated into the stream below.
This is an apt illustration of what we call credit. It will bear, and with
success, considerable pressure if it be irregular, dropping, and
incidental. Let the forces, however, be at once consentaneous and united,&mdash;let
the men keep step,&mdash;and down comes the bridge! Ah, Hankes, am I not
right?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I believe you are, sir,&rdquo; said Hankes, who was not quite certain that he
comprehended the illustration.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;His Lordship is waiting breakfast, sir,&rdquo; said a smartly dressed footman
at the door.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I will be down in a moment. I believe, Hankes, we have not forgotten
anything? The Cloyne and Carrick Company had better be wound up; and that
waste-land project&mdash;let me have the papers to look over. You think we
ought to discount those bills of Barrington's?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm sure of it, sir. The people at the Royal Bank would take them
to-morrow.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The credit of the Bank must be upheld, Hankes. The libellous articles of
those newspapers are doing us great damage, timid shareholders assail us
with letters, and some have actually demanded back their deposits. I have
it, Hankes!&rdquo; cried he, as a sudden thought struck him,&mdash;&ldquo;I have it!
Take a special train at once for town, and fetch me the balance-sheet and
the list of all convertible securities. You can be back here&mdash;let us
see&mdash;by to-morrow at noon, or, at latest, to-morrow evening. By that
time I shall have matured my plan.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I should like to hear some hint of what you intend,&rdquo; said Hankes.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You shall know all to-morrow,&rdquo; said he, as he nodded a good-bye, and
descended to the breakfast-room. He turned short, however, at the foot of
the stairs, and returned to his chamber, where Hankes was still packing up
his papers. &ldquo;On second thoughts, Hankes, I believe I had better tell you
now,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And they both eat down at the table, end never moved from it for an hour.
Twice&mdash;even thrice&mdash;there cane messages from below, requesting
Mr. Dunn's presence at the breakfast-table, but a hurried &ldquo;Yes,
immediately,&rdquo; was his reply, and he came not.
</p>
<p>
At last they rose? Hankes the first, saying, as he looked at his watch, &ldquo;I
shall just be in time. It is a great idea, a very great idea indeed, and
does you infinite credit.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It ought to have success, Hankes,&rdquo; said he, calmly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ought, Sir! It will succeed. It is as fine a piece of tactics as I ever
heard of. Trust me to carry it out, that's all.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Remember, Hankes, time is everything. Goodby!&rdquo;

<h2>
CHAPTER XLI. &ldquo;A COUNTRY WALK&rdquo;
 </h2>
<p>
What a charming day was that at the Hermitage,&mdash;every one pleased,
happy, and good-humored! With a frankness that gave universal
satisfaction, Mr. Dunn declared he could not tear himself away.
Engagements the most pressing, business appointments of the deepest
moment, awaited him on every side, but, &ldquo;No matter what it cost,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;I will have my holiday!&rdquo; Few flatteries are more successful than those
little appeals to the charms and fascinations of a quiet home circle; and
when some hard-worked man of the world, some eminent leader at the Bar, or
some much-sought physician condescends to tell us that the world of
clients must wait while he lingers in our society, the assurance never
fails to be pleasing. It is, indeed, complimentary to feel that we are, in
all the easy indolence of leisure, enjoying the hours of one whose minutes
are valued as guineas; our own value insensibly rises at the thought, and
we associate ourselves in our estimate of the great man. When Mr.
Davenport Dunn had made this graceful declaration, he added another, not
less gratifying, that he was completely at his Lordship's and Lady
Augusta's orders, as regarded the great project on which they desired to
have his opinion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The best way is to come down and see the spot yourself, Dunn. We 'll walk
over there together, and Augusta will acquaint you with our notions as we
go along.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I ought to mention,&rdquo; said Dunn, &ldquo;that yesterday, by the merest chance, I
had the opportunity of looking over a little sketch of your project.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Miss Kellett's!&rdquo; broke in Lady Augusta, coloring slightly. &ldquo;It is
very clever, very prettily written, but scarcely practical, scarcely
business-like enough for a prosaic person like myself. A question of this
kind is a great financial problem, not a philanthropic experiment. Don't
you agree with me?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; said he, bowing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And its merits are to be tested by figures, and not by Utopian dreams of
felicity. Don't you think so?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He bowed again, and smiled approvingly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am aware,&rdquo; said she, in a sort of half confusion, &ldquo;what rashness it
would be in me to say this to any one less largely minded than yourself;
how I should expose myself to the censure of being narrow-hearted and
worldly, and so forth; but I am not afraid of such judgments from you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nor have you need to dread them,&rdquo; said he, in a voice a little above a
whisper.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Young ladies, like Miss Kellett, are often possessed by the ambition&mdash;a
very laudable sentiment, no doubt&mdash;of distinguishing themselves by
these opinions. It is, as it were, a 'trick of the time' we live in, and,
with those who do not move in 'society,' has its success too.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The peculiar intonation of that one word &ldquo;society&rdquo; gave the whole point
and direction of this speech. There was in it that which seemed to say, &ldquo;<i>This</i>
is the real tribunal! Here is the one true court where claims are
recognized and shams nonsuited.&rdquo; Nor was it lost upon Mr. Davenport Dunn.
More than once&mdash;ay, many a time before&mdash;had he been struck by
the reference to that Star Chamber of the well-bred world. He had even
heard a noble lord on the Treasury benches sneer down a sturdy champion of
Manchesterism, by suggesting that in a certain circle, where the honorable
gentleman never came, very different opinions prevailed from those
announced by him.
</p>
<p>
While Dunn was yet pondering over this mystic word, Lord Glengariff came
to say that, as Miss Kellett required his presence to look over some
papers in the library, they might stroll slowly along till he overtook
them.
</p>
<p>
As they sauntered along under the heavy shade of the great beech-trees,
the sun streaking at intervals the velvety sward beneath their feet, while
the odor of the fresh hay was wafted by on a faint light breeze, Dunn was
unconsciously brought back in memory to the &ldquo;long, long ago,&rdquo; when he
walked the self-same spot in a gloom only short of despair. Who could have
predicted the day when he should stroll there, with <i>her</i> at his
side, <i>her</i> arm within his own, <i>her</i> voice appealing in tones
of confidence and friendship? His great ambitions had grown with his
successes, and as he rose higher and higher, his aims continued to mount
upwards; but here was a sentiment that dated from the time of his
obscurity, here a day-dream that had filled his imagination when from
imagination alone could be derived the luxury of triumph, and now it was
realized, and now&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Who is to say what strange wild conflict went on within that heart where
worldliness felt its sway for once disputed? Did there yet linger there,
in the midst of high ambitions, some trait of boyish love, or was it that
he felt this hour to be the crowning triumph of his long life of toil?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;If I were not half ashamed to disturb your revery,&rdquo; said Lady Augusta,
smiling, &ldquo;I'd tell you to look at that view yonder. See where the coast
stretches along there, broken by cliff and headland, with those rocky
islands breaking the calm sea-line, and say if you saw anything finer in
your travels abroad?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Was I in a revery? have I been dreaming?&rdquo; cried he, suddenly, not
regarding the scene, but turning his eyes fully upon herself. &ldquo;And yet you
'd forgive me were I to confess to you of what it was I was thinking.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then tell it directly, for I own your silence piqued me, and I stopped
speaking when I perceived I was not listened to.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps I am too confident when I say you would forgive me?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have it in your power to learn, at all events,&rdquo; said she, laughingly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But not to recall my words if they should have been uttered rashly,&rdquo; said
he, slowly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Shall I tell you a great fault you have,&mdash;perhaps your greatest?&rdquo;
 asked she, quickly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do, I entreat of you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you pledge yourself to take my candor well, and bear me no malice
afterwards?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is a coldness,&mdash;a reserve almost amounting to distrust, which
seems actually to dominate in your temper. Be frank with me, now, and say
fairly, was not this long alley reylying all the thoughts of long ago, and
were you not summing up the fifty-one little grudges you had against that
poor silly child who used to torment and fret you, and, instead of
honestly owning all this, you fell back upon that stern dignity of manner
I have just complained of? Besides,&rdquo; added she, as though hurried away by
some strong impulse, &ldquo;if it would quiet your spirit to know you were
avenged, you may feel satisfied.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;As how?&rdquo; asked he, eagerly, and not comprehending to what she pointed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Simply thus,&rdquo; resumed she. &ldquo;As I continued to mark and read of your great
career in life, the marvellous successes which met you in each new
enterprise, how with advancing fortune you ever showed yourself equal to
the demand made upon your genius, I thought with shame and humiliation
over even my childish follies, how often I must have grieved&mdash;have
hurt you! Over and over have I said, 'Does he ever remember? Can he
forgive me?' And yet there was a sense of exquisite pleasure in the midst
of all my sorrow as I thought over all these childish vanities, and said
to myself, 'This man, whom all are now flattering and fawning upon, was
the same I used to irritate with my caprices, and worry with my whims!'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I never dreamed that you remembered me,&rdquo; said he, in a voice tremulous
with delight.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your career made a romance for me,&rdquo; said she, eagerly. &ldquo;I could repeat
many of those vigorous speeches you made,&mdash;those spirited addresses.
One, in particular, I remember well; it was when refusing the offer of the
Athlone burgesses to represent their town; you alluded so happily to the
cares which occupied you,&mdash;less striking than legislative duties, but
not less important,&mdash;or, as you phrased it, yours was like the part
of those 'who sound the depth and buoy the course that thundering
three-deckers are to follow.' Do you remember the passage? And again, that
proud humility with which, alluding to the wants of the poor, you said,
'I, who have carried my musket in the ranks of the people!' Let me tell
you, sir,&rdquo; added she, playfully, &ldquo;these are very haughty avowals, after
all, and savor just as much of personal pride as the insolent declarations
of many a pampered courtier!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Dunn's face grew crimson, and his chest swelled with an emotion of intense
delight.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Shall I own to you,&rdquo; continued she, still running on with what seemed an
irrepressible freedom, &ldquo;that it appears scarcely real to me to be here
talking to you about yourself, and your grand enterprises, and your
immense speculations. You have been so long to my mind the great genius of
wondrous achievements, that I cannot yet comprehend the condescension of
your strolling along here as if this world could spare you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
If Dunn did not speak, it was that his heart was too full for words; but
he pressed the round arm that leaned upon him closer to his side, and felt
a thrill of happiness through him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said she, after a pause, &ldquo;I have a favor to ask of you: papa
would be charmed to have a cast of Marochetti's bust of you, and yet does
not like to ask for it. May I venture&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Too great an honor to me,&rdquo; muttered Dunn. &ldquo;Would you&mdash;I mean, would
he&mdash;accept&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I will, and with gratitude; not but I think the likeness hard and
harsh. It is, very probably, what you are to that marvellous world of
politicians and financiers you live amongst, but not such as your friends
recognize you,&mdash;what you are to-day, for instance.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what may that be,&rdquo; asked he, playfully.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was going to say an impudence, and I only caught myself in time.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do, then, let me hear it,&rdquo; said he, eagerly, &ldquo;for I am quite ready to cap
it with another.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yours be the first, then,&rdquo; said she, laughing. &ldquo;Is it not customary to
put the amendment before the original motion?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Both Mr. Dunn and his fair companion were destined to be rescued from the
impending indiscretion by the arrival of Lord Glengariff, who, mounted on
his pony, suddenly appeared beside them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, Dunn,&rdquo; cried he, as he came up, &ldquo;has she made a convert of you? Are
you going to advocate the great project here?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Dunn looked sideways towards Lady Augusta, who, seeing his difficulty, at
once said, &ldquo;Indeed, papa, we never spoke of the scheme. I doubt if either
of us as much as remembered there was such a thing.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, I'm charmed to find that your society could prove so fascinating,
Augusta,&rdquo; said Lord Glengariff, with some slight irritation of manner,
&ldquo;but I must ask of Mr. Dunn to bear with me while I descend to the very
commonplace topic which has such interest for me. The very spot we stand
on is admirably suited to take a panoramic view of our little bay, the
village, and the background. Carry your eyes along towards the rocky
promontory on which the stone pines are standing; we begin there.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Now, most worthy reader, although the noble Lord pledged himself to be
brief, and really meant to keep his word, and although he fancied himself
to be graphic,&mdash;truth is truth,&mdash;he was lamentably prolix and
confused beyond all endurance. As for Dunn, he listened with an exemplary
patience; perhaps his thoughts were rambling away elsewhere,&mdash;perhaps
he was compensated for the weariness by the occasional glances which met
him from eyes now downcast, now bent softly upon him. Meanwhile the old
Lord floundered on, amidst crescents and bathing-lodges, yacht stations
and fisheries, aiding his memory occasionally with little notes, which, as
he contrived to mistake, only served to make the description less
intelligible. At length he had got so far as to conjure up a busy,
thriving, well-to-do watering-place, sought after by the fashionable world
that once had loved Brighton or Dieppe. He had peopled the shore with
loungers, and the hotels with visitors; equipages were seen flocking in,
and a hissing steamer in the harbor was already sounding the note of
departure for Liverpool or Holyhead, when Dunn, suddenly rousing himself
from what might have been a revery, said, &ldquo;And the money, my Lord,&mdash;the
means to do all this?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The money&mdash;the means&mdash;we look to <i>you</i>, Dunn, to answer
that question. Our scheme is a great shareholding company of five thousand&mdash;no,
fifty&mdash;nay, I 'm wrong. What is it, Augusta?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The exact amount scarcely signifies much, my Lord. The excellence of the
project once proved, money can always be had. What I desired to know was,
if you already possessed the confidence of some great capitalist favorable
to the undertaking, or is it simply its intrinsic merits which recommend
it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Its own merits, of course,&rdquo; broke in Lord Glengariff, hastily. &ldquo;Are they
not sufficient?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am not in a position to affirm or deny that opinion,&rdquo; said Dunn,
gravely. &ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; added he, to himself, while he drew a pencil from
his pocket, and on the back of a letter proceeded to scratch certain
figures. He continued to calculate thus for some minutes, when at last he
said: &ldquo;If you like to try it, my Lord, with an advance of say twenty
thousand pounds, there will be no great difficulty in raising the money.
Once afloat, you will be in a position to enlist shareholders easily
enough.&rdquo; He spoke with all the cool indifference of one discussing the
weather.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I must say, Dunn,&rdquo; cried Lord Glengariff, with warmth, &ldquo;this is a very
noble&mdash;a very generous offer. I conclude my personal security&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We can talk over all this at another time, my Lord,&rdquo; broke in Dunn,
smiling. &ldquo;Lady Augusta will leave us if we go into questions of bonds and
parchments. My first care will be to send you down Mr. Steadman, a very
competent person, who will make the necessary surveys; his report, too,
will be important in the share market.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;So that the scheme enlists your co-operation, Dunn,&mdash;so that we have
<i>you</i> with us,&rdquo; cried the old Lord, rubbing his hands, &ldquo;I have no
fears as to success.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;May we reckon upon so much?&rdquo; whispered Lady Augusta, while a long, soft,
meaning glance stole from her eyes.
</p>
<p>
Dunn bent his head in assent, while his face grew crimson.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I say, Augusta,&rdquo; whispered Lord Glengariff, &ldquo;we have made a capital
morning's work of it&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I hope so, too,&rdquo; said she. And her eyes sparkled with an expression of
triumph.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is only one condition I would bespeak, my Lord. It is this: the
money market at this precise moment is unsettled, over-speculation has
already created a sort of panic, so that you will kindly give me a little
time&mdash;very little will do&mdash;to arrange the advance. Three weeks
ago we were actually glutted with money, and now there are signs of what
is called tightness in discounts.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Consult your own convenience in every respect,&rdquo; said the old Lord,
courteously.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nothing would surprise me less than a financial crisis over here,&rdquo; said
Dunn, solemnly. &ldquo;Our people have been rash in their investments latterly,
and there is always a retribution upon inordinate gain!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Whether it was the topic itself warmed him, or the gentle pressure of Lady
Augusta's arm as in encouragement of his sentiments, but Dunn continued to
&ldquo;improve the occasion&rdquo; as they strolled along homeward, inveighing in very
choice terms against speculative gambling, and deploring the injury done
to honest, patient industry by those examples of wealth acquired without
toil and accumulated without thrift. He really treated the question well
and wisely, and when he passed from the mere financial consideration to
the higher one of &ldquo;morals&rdquo; and the influence exerted upon national
character, he actually grew eloquent.
</p>
<p>
Let us acknowledge that the noble Lord did not participate in all his
daughter's admiration of this high-sounding harangue, nor was he without a
sort of lurking suspicion that he was listening to a lecture upon his, own
greed and covetousness; he, however, contrived to throw in at intervals
certain little words of concurrence, and in this way occupied they arrived
at the Hermitage.
</p>
<p>
It is not always that the day which dawns happily continues bright and
unclouded to its close; yet this was such a one. The dinner passed off
most agreeably, the evening in the drawing-room was delightful. Lady
Augusta sang prettily enough to please even a more critical ear than Mr.
Dunn's, and she had a tact, often wanting in better performers, to select
the class of music likely to prove agreeable to her hearers. There is a
very considerable number of people who like pictures for the story and
music for the sentiment, and for these high art is less required than
something which shall appeal to their peculiar taste. But, while we are
confessing, let us own that if Mr. Dunn liked &ldquo;the melodies,&rdquo; it assuredly
added to their charm to hear them sung by a peer's daughter; and as he lay
back in his well-cushioned chair, and drank in the sweet sounds, it seemed
to him that he was passing a very charming evening.
</p>
<p>
Like many other vulgar men in similar circumstances, he wondered at the
ease and unconstraint he felt in such choice company! He could not help
contrasting the tranquil beatitude of his sensations with what he had
fancied must be the coldness and reserve of such society. He was, as he
muttered to himself, as much at home as in his own house; and truly, as
with one hand in his breast, while with the fingers of the other he beat
time,&mdash;and all falsely,&mdash;he looked the very ideal of his order.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Confound the fellow!&rdquo; muttered the old peer, as he glanced at him over
his newspaper, &ldquo;he is insufferably at his ease amongst us!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And Sybella Kellett, where was she all this time&mdash;or have we
forgotten her? Poor Sybella! she had been scarcely noticed at dinner,
scarcely spoken to in the drawing-room, and she had slipped unperceived
away to her own room.
</p>
<p>
They never missed her.

<h2>
CHAPTER XLII. THE GERM OF A BOLD STROKE
</h2>
<p>
If Mr. Davenport Dunn had passed a day of unusual happiness and ease, the
night which followed was destined to be one of intense labor and toil.
Scarcely had the quiet of repose settled down upon the Hermitage, than the
quick tramp of horses, urged to their sharpest trot, was heard
approaching, and soon after Mr. Hankes descended from his
travelling-carriage at the door.
</p>
<p>
Dunn had been standing at his open window gazing into the still obscurity
of the night, and wondering at what time he might expect him, when he
arrived.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have made haste, Hankes,&rdquo; said he, not wasting a word in salutation.
&ldquo;I scarcely looked to see you before daybreak.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir; the special train behaved well, and the posters did their part
as creditably. I had about four hours altogether in Dublin, but they were
quite sufficient for everything.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;For everything?&rdquo; repeated Dunn.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; you'll find nothing has been forgotten. Before leaving Cork, I
telegraphed to Meekins of the 'Post,' and to Browne of the 'Banner,' to
meet me on my arrival at Henrietta Street. Strange enough, they both were
anxiously waiting for some instructions on the very question at issue.
They came armed with piles of provincial papers, all written in the same
threatening style. One in particular, the 'Upper Ossory Beacon,' had an
article headed, 'Who is our Dionysius?'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Never mind that,&rdquo; broke in Dunn, impatiently. &ldquo;You explained to them the
line to be taken?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Fully, sir. I told them that they were to answer the attacks weakly,
feebly, deprecating in general terms the use of personalities, and
throwing out little appeals for forbearance, and so on. On the question of
the Bank, I said, 'Be somewhat more resolute; hint that certain aspersions
might be deemed actionable; that wantonly to assail credit is an offence
punishable at law; and then dwell upon the benefits already diffused by
these establishments, and implore all who have the interest of Ireland at
heart not to suffer a spirit of faction to triumph over their
patriotism.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Will they understand the part?&rdquo; asked Dunn, more impatiently than before.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Thoroughly; Browne, indeed, has a leader already 'set up'&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What do I care for all these?&rdquo; broke in Dunn, peevishly. &ldquo;Surely no man
knows better than yourself that these fellows are only the feathers that
show where the wind blows. As to any influence they wield over public
opinion, you might as well tell me that the man who sweats a guinea can
sway the Stock Exchange.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Hankes shook his head dissentingly, but made no reply.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have brought the Bank accounts and the balance-sheet?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, they are all here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Have you made any rough calculation as to the amount&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Fifty thousand ought to cover it easily&mdash;I mean with what they have
themselves in hand. The first day will be a heavy one, but I don't suspect
the second will, particularly when it is known that we are discounting
freely as ever.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And now as to the main point?&rdquo; said Dunn.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;All right, sir. Etheridge's securities give us seventeen thousand; we
have a balance of about eleven on that account of Lord Lackington; I drew
out the twelve hundred of Kellett's at once; and several other small sums,
which are all ready.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It <i>is</i> a bold stroke!&rdquo; muttered Dunn, musingly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;None but an original mind could have hit upon it, sir. I used to think
the late Mr. Robins a very great man, sir,&mdash;and he <i>was</i> a great
man,&mdash;but this is a cut above him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let us say so when it has succeeded, Hankes,&rdquo; said Dunn, with a
half-smile.
</p>
<p>
As he spoke, he seated himself at the table, and, opening a massive
account-book, was soon deep in its details. Hankes took a place beside
him, and they both continued to con over the long column of figures
together.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We stand in a safer position than I thought, Hankes,&rdquo; said Dunn, leaning
back in his chair.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir; we have been nursing this Ossory Bank for some time. You
remember, some time ago, saying to me, 'Hankes, put condition on that
horse, we 'll have to ride him hard before the season is over'?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, you have done it cleverly, I must say,&rdquo; resumed Dunn. &ldquo;This concern
is almost solvent.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Almost, sir,&rdquo; echoed Hankes.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What a shake it will give them all, Hankes,&rdquo; said Dunn, gleefully, &ldquo;when
it once sets in, as it will and must, powerfully! The Provincial will
stand easily enough.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be sure, sir.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And the Royal, also; but the 'Tyrawley'&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And the 'Four Counties,'&rdquo; added Hankes. &ldquo;Driscoll is ready with four
thousand of the notes 'to open the ball,' as he says, and when Terry's
name gets abroad it will be worse to them than a placard on the walls.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I shall not be sorry for the 'Four Counties.' It was Mr. Morris, the
chairman, had the insolence to allude to me in the House, and ask if it
were true that the Ministry had recommended Mr. Davenport Dunn as a fit
object for the favors of the Crown? That question, sir, placed my claim in
abeyance ever since. The Minister, pledged solemnly to me, had to rise in
his place and say 'No.' Of course he added the stereotyped sarcasm, 'Not
that, if such a decision had been come to, need the Cabinet have shrunk
from the responsibility through any fears of the honorable gentleman's
indignation.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, Mr. Morris will have to pay for his joke now,&rdquo; said Hankes. &ldquo;I 'm
told his whole estate is liable to the Bank.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Every shilling of it. Driscoll has got me all the details.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Lushington will be the great sufferer by the 'Tyrawley,'&rdquo; continued
Hankes.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Another of them, Hankes,&mdash;another of them,&rdquo; cried Dunn, rubbing his
hands joyfully. &ldquo;Tom Lushington&mdash;the Honorable Tom, as they called
him&mdash;blackballed me at 'Brookes's. They told me his very words: 'It's
bad enough to be &ldquo;Dunned,&rdquo; as we are, out of doors, but let us, at least,
be safe from the infliction at our Clubs.' A sorry jest, but witty enough
for those who heard it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don't think he has sixpence.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, sir; nor can he remain a Treasury Lord with a fiat of bankruptcy
against him. So much, then, for Tom Lushington! I tell you, Hankes,&rdquo; said
he, spiritedly, &ldquo;next week will have its catalogue of shipwrecks. There's
a storm about to break that none have yet suspected.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There will be some heavy sufferers,&rdquo; said Hankes gravely.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No doubt, no doubt,&rdquo; muttered Dunn. &ldquo;I never heard of a battle without
killed and wounded. I tell you, sir, again,&rdquo; said he, raising his voice,
&ldquo;before the week ends the shore will be strewn with fragments; we alone
will ride through the gale unharmed. It is not fully a month since I
showed the Chief Secretary here&mdash;ay, and his Excellency, also&mdash;the
insolent but insidious system of attack the Government journals maintain
against me, the half-covert insinuations, the impertinent queries,
pretended inquiries for mere information's sake. Of course, I got for
answer the usual cant about 'freedom of the press,' 'liberty of public
discussion,' with the accustomed assurance that the Government had not, in
reality, any recognized organ; and, to wind up, there was the laughing
question, 'And what do you care, after all, for these fellows?' But now I
will show what I <i>do</i> care,&mdash;that I have good and sufficient
reason to care,&mdash;that the calumnies which assail me are directed
against my material interests; that it is not Davenport Dunn is 'in
cause,' but all the great enterprises associated with his name; that it is
not an individual, but the industry of a nation, is at stake; and I will
say to them, 'Protect me, or&mdash;' You remember the significant legend
inscribed on the cannon of the Irish Volunteers, 'Independence or&mdash;'
Take my word for it, I may not speak as loudly as the nine-pounder, but my
fire will be to the full as fatal!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Never before had Hankes seen his chief carried away by any sense of
personal injury; he had even remarked, amongst the traits of his great
business capacity, that a calm contempt for mere passing opinion was his
characteristic, and he was sorely grieved to find that such equanimity
could be disturbed. With his own especial quickness Dunn saw what was
passing in his lieutenant's mind, and he added hastily,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Not that, of all men, I need care for such assaults; powerful even to
tyranny as the press has become amongst us, there is one thing more
powerful still, and that is&mdash;Prosperity! Ay, sir, there may be cavil
and controversy as to your abilities; some may condemn your speech, or
carp at your book, they may cry down your statecraft, or deny your
diplomacy; but there is a test that all can appreciate, all comprehend,
and that is&mdash;Success. Have only <i>that</i>, Hankes, and the world is
with you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;There's no denying that,&rdquo; said Hankes, solemnly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is the gauge of every man,&rdquo; resumed Dunn,&mdash;&ldquo;from him that
presides over a Railway Board to him that sways an Empire. And justly so,
too,&rdquo; added he, rapidly. &ldquo;A man must be a consummate judge of horseflesh
that could pick out the winner of the Oaks in a stable; but the scrubbiest
varlet on the field can <i>see</i> who comes in first on the day of the
race! Have you ever been in America, Hankes?&rdquo; asked he, suddenly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; all over the States. I think I know Cousin Jonathan as well as I
know old John himself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You know a very shrewd fellow, then,&rdquo; muttered Dunn; &ldquo;over-shrewd,
mayhap.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What led you to think of that country now?&rdquo; asked the other, curiously.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I scarcely know,&rdquo; said Dunn, carelessly, as he walked the room in
thoughtfulness; then added, &ldquo;If no recognition were to come of these
services of mine, I 'd just as soon live there as here. I should, at
least, be on the level of the best above me. Well,&rdquo; cried he, in a higher
tone, &ldquo;we have some trumps to play out ere it come to that.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Once more they turned to the account books and the papers before them, for
Hankes had many things to explain and various difficulties to unravel. The
vast number of those enterprises in which Dunn engaged had eventually
blended and mingled all their interests together. Estates and shipping,
and banks, mines, railroads, and dock companies had so often interchanged
their securities, each bolstering up the credit of the other in turn, that
the whole resembled some immense fortress, where the garrison, too weak
for a general defence, was always hastening to some one point or other,&mdash;the
seat of immediate attack. And thus an Irish draining-fund was one day
called upon to liquidate the demands upon a sub-Alpine railroad, while a
Mexican tin-mine flew to the rescue of a hosiery scheme in Balbriggan! To
have ever a force ready on the point assailed was Dunn's remarkable
talent, and he handled his masses like a great master of war.
</p>
<p>
Partly out of that indolent insolence which power begets, he had latterly
been less mindful of the press, less alive to the strictures of
journalism, and attacks were made upon him which, directed as they were
against his solvency, threatened at any moment to assume a dangerous
shape. Roused at last by the peril, he had determined on playing a bold
game for fortune; and this it was which now engaged his thoughts, and
whose details the dawning day saw him deeply considering. His now great
theory was that a recognized station amongst the nobles of the land was
the one only security against disaster. &ldquo;Once amongst them,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;they will defend me as one of their order.&rdquo; How to effect this grand
object had been the long study of his life. But it was more,&mdash;it was
also his secret! They who fancied they knew the man, thoroughly understood
the habits of his mind, his passions, his prejudices, and his hopes, never
as much as suspected what lay at the bottom of them all. He assumed a sort
of manner that in a measure disarmed their suspicion; he affected pride in
that middle station of life he occupied, and seemed to glory in those
glowing eulogies of commercial ability and capacity which it was the good
pleasure of leading journalists just then to deliver. On public occasions
he made an even ostentatious display of these sentiments, and Davenport
Dunn was often quoted as a dangerous man for an hereditary aristocracy to
have against them.
</p>
<p>
Such was he who now pored over complicated details of figures, intricate
and tangled schemes of finance; and yet, while his mind embraced them,
with other thoughts was he picturing to himself a time when, proud amongst
the proudest, he would take his place with the great nobles of the land.
It was evident that another had not regarded this ambition as fanciful or
extravagant. Lady Augusta&mdash;the haughty daughter of one of the
haughtiest in the peerage&mdash;as much as said, &ldquo;It was a fair and
reasonable object of hope; then none could deny the claims he preferred,
nor any affect to undervalue the vast benefits he had conferred on his
country.&rdquo; There was something so truly kind, so touching too, in the
generous tone she assumed, that Dunn dwelt upon it again and again.
Knowing all the secret instincts of that mysterious brotherhood as she
did, Dunn imagined to himself all the advantage her advice and counsels
could render him. &ldquo;She can direct me in many ways, teaching me how to
treat these mysterious high-priests as I ought What shall I do to secure
her favor? How enlist it in my cause? Could I make her partner in the
enterprise?&rdquo; As the thought flashed across him, his cheek burned as if
with a flame, and he rose abruptly from the table and walked to the
window, fearful lest his agitation might be observed. &ldquo;That were success,
indeed!&rdquo; muttered he. &ldquo;What a strong bail-bond would it be when I called
two English peers my brothers-in-law, and an earl for my wife's father!
This would at once lead me to the very step of the 'Order.' How many noble
families would it interest in my elevation! The Ardens are the best blood
of the south, connected widely with the highest in both countries. Is it
possible that this could succeed?&rdquo; He thought of the old Earl and his
intense pride of birth, and his heart misgave him; but then, Lady
Augusta's gentle tones and gentler looks came to his mind, and he
remembered that though a peer's daughter, she was penniless, and&mdash;we
shame to write it&mdash;not young. The Lady Augusta Arden marries the
millionnaire Mr. Dunn, and the world understands the compact There are
many such matches every season.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What age would you guess me to be, Hankes?&rdquo; said he, suddenly turning
round.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I should call you&mdash;let me see&mdash;a matter of forty-five or
forty-six, sir.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Older, Hankes,&mdash;older,&rdquo; said he, with a smile of half-pleasure.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You don't look it, sir, I protest you don't. Sitting up all night and
working over these accounts, one might, perhaps, call you forty-six; but
seeing you as you come down to breakfast after your natural rest, you
don't seem forty.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;This same life is too laborious; a man may follow it for the ten or
twelve years of his prime, but it becomes downright slavery after that.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But what is an active mind like yours to do, sir?&rdquo; asked Hankes.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Take his ease and rest himself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ease!&mdash;rest! All a mistake, sir. Great business men can't exist in
that lethargy called leisure.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are quite wrong, Hankes; if I were the master of some venerable old
demesne, like this, for instance, with its timber of centuries' growth,
and its charms of scenery, such as we see around us here, I 'd ask no
better existence than to pass my days in calm retirement, invite a stray
friend or two to come and see me, and with books and other resources hold
myself aloof from stocks and statecraft, and not so much as ask how are
the Funds or who is the Minister.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'd be sorry to see you come to that, sir, I declare I should,&rdquo; said
Hankes, earnestly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You may live to see it, notwithstanding,&rdquo; said Dunn, with a placid smile.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, sir,&rdquo; said Hankes, &ldquo;it's not the man who has just conceived such a
grand idea as this &ldquo;&mdash;and he touched the books before him&mdash;&ldquo;ought
to talk about turning hermit.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;We'll see, Hankes,&mdash;we'll see,&rdquo; said Dunn, calmly. &ldquo;There come the
post-horses&mdash;I suppose for you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir; I ordered them to be here at six. I thought I should have had a
couple of hours in bed by that time; but it does n't signify, I can sleep
anywhere.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said Dunn, calculating. &ldquo;This is Tuesday; now, Friday ought
to be the day, the news to reach me on Thursday afternoon; you can send a
telegraphic message and then send on a clerk. Of course, you will know how
to make these communications properly. It is better I should remain here
in the interval; it looks like security.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you mean to come over yourself, sir?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Of course I do. You must meet me there on Friday morning. Let Mrs. Hailes
have the house in readiness in case I might invite any one.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;All shall be attended to ir,&rdquo; said Hankes. &ldquo;I think I'll despatch Wilkins
to you with the news; he's an awful fellow to exaggerate evil tidings.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Dunn. &ldquo;Good-night, or, I opine, rather, good-morning.&rdquo;
 And he turned away into his bedroom.

<h2>
CHAPTER XLIII. THE GARDEN
</h2>
<p>
From the moment that Mr. Davenport Dunn announced he would still continue
to enjoy the hospitality of the Hermitage, a feeling of intimacy grew up
between himself and his host that almost savored of old friendship. Lord
Glengariff already saw in the distance wealth and affluence; he had
secured a co-operation that never knew failure,&mdash;the one man whose
energies could always guarantee success.
</p>
<p>
It was true, Dunn had not directly pledged himself to anything; he had
listened and questioned and inquired and reflected, but given nothing like
a definite opinion, far less a promise. But, as the old Lord said, &ldquo;These
fellows are always cautious, always reserved; and whenever they do not
oppose, it may be assumed that they concur. At all events, we must manage
with delicacy; there must be no haste, no importunity; the best advocacy
we can offer to our plans is to make his visit here as agreeable as
possible.&rdquo; Such was the wise counsel he gave his daughter as they strolled
through the garden after breakfast, talking over the character and the
temperament of their guest.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;By George, Gusty!&rdquo; cried Lord Glengariff, after a moment's silence, &ldquo;I
cannot yet persuade myself that this is 'Old Davy,' as you and the girls
used to call him long ago. Of all the miraculous transformations I have
ever witnessed, none of them approaches this!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is wonderful, indeed!&rdquo; said she, slowly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is not that he has acquired or increased his stock of knowledge,&mdash;that
would not have puzzled me so much, seeing the life of labor he has led,&mdash;but
I go on asking myself what has become of his former self, of which not a
trace nor vestige remains? Where is his shy, hesitating manner, his
pedantry, his suspicion,&mdash;where the intense eagerness to learn what
was going on in the house? You remember how his prying disposition used to
worry us?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said she, in a low voice.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There is something, now, in his calm, quiet deportment very like dignity.
I protest I should&mdash;seeing him for the first time&mdash;call him a
well-bred man.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said she, in the same tone.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;As little was I prepared for the frank and open manner in which he spoke
to me of himself.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Has he done so?&rdquo; asked she, with some animation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; with much candor, and much good sense too. He sees the obstacles he
has surmounted in life, and he just as plainly perceives those that are
not to be overcome.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What may these latter be?&rdquo; asked she, cautiously.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is pretty obvious what they are,&rdquo; said he, half pettishly,&mdash;&ldquo;his
family; his connections; his station, in fact.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;How did he speak of these,&mdash;in what terms, I mean?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Modestly and fairly. He did not conceal what he owned to feel as certain
hardships, but he was just enough to acknowledge that our social system
was a sound one, and worked well.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was a great admission,&rdquo; said she, with a very faint smile.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Radical crept out only once,&rdquo; said the old Lord, laughing at the
recollection. &ldquo;It was when I remarked that an ancient nobility, like a
diamond, required centuries of crystallization to give it lustre and
coherence. 'It were well to bear in mind, my Lord,' said he, 'that it
began by being only charcoal.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
She gave a low, quiet laugh, but said nothing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He has very sound notions in many things,&mdash;very sound, indeed. I
wish, with all my heart, that more of the class he belongs to were
animated with <i>his</i> sentiments. He is no advocate for pulling down;
moderate, reasonable changes,&mdash;changes in conformity with the spirit
of the age, in fact,&mdash;these he advocates. As I have already said,
Gusty, these men are only dangerous when our own exclusiveness has made
them so. Treat them fairly, admit them to your society, listen to their
arguments, refute them, show them where they have mistaken us, and they
are <i>not</i> dangerous.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you are right,&rdquo; said she, musingly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Another thing astonishes me: he has no pride of purse about him; at
least, I cannot detect it. He talks of money reasonably and fairly,
acknowledges what it can and what it cannot do&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what, pray, is that?&rdquo; broke she in, hastily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don't think there can be much dispute on <i>that</i> score!&rdquo; said he,
in a voice of pique. &ldquo;The sturdiest advocate for the power of wealth never
presumed to say it could make a man,&mdash;one of us!&rdquo; said he, after a
pause, that sent the blood to his face.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But it can, and does, every day,&rdquo; said she, resolutely. &ldquo;Our peerage is
invigorated by the wealth as well as by the talent of the class beneath
it; and if Mr. Dunn be the millionnaire that common report proclaims him,
I should like to know why that wealth, and all the influence that it
wields, should not be associated with the institutions to which we owe our
stability.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;The wealth and the influence if you like, only not himself,&rdquo; said the
Earl, with a saucy laugh. &ldquo;My dear Augusta,&rdquo; he added, in a gentle tone,
&ldquo;he is a most excellent and a very useful man&mdash;where he is. The age
suits him, and he suits the age. We live in stirring times, when these
sharp intellects have an especial value.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You talk as if these men were <i>your</i> tools. Is it not just possible
you may be <i>theirs?</i>&rdquo; said she, impatiently.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What monstrous absurdity is this, child!&rdquo; replied he, angrily. &ldquo;It is&mdash;it
is downright&mdash;&rdquo; he grew purple in the endeavor to find the right
word,&mdash;&ldquo;downright Chartism!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If so, the Chartists have more of my sympathy than I was aware of.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Fortunately for both, the sudden appearance of Dunn himself put an end to
a discussion which each moment threatened to become perilous, and whose
unpleasant effects were yet visible on their faces. Lord Glengariff had
not sufficiently recovered his composure to do more than salute Mr. Dunn;
while Lady Augusta's confusion was even yet more marked. They had not
walked many steps in company, when Lord Glengariff was recalled to the
cottage by the visit of a neighboring magistrate, and Lady Augusta found
herself alone with Mr. Dunn.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am afraid, Lady Augusta,&rdquo; said he, timidly, &ldquo;my coming up was
inopportune. I suspect I must have interrupted some confidential
conversation.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, nothing of the kind,&rdquo; said she, frankly. &ldquo;My father and I were
discussing what we can never agree upon, and what every day seems to widen
the breach of opinion between us, and I am well pleased that your arrival
should have closed the subject.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I never meant to play eavesdropper, Lady Augusta,&rdquo; said he, earnestly;
&ldquo;but as I came up the grass alley I heard my own name mentioned twice. Am
I indiscreet in asking to what circumstance I owe the honor of engaging
your attention?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don't exactly know how to tell you,&rdquo; said she, blushing. &ldquo;Not, indeed,
but that the subject was one on which your own sentiments would be far
more interesting than our speculations; but in repeating what passed
between us, I might, perhaps, give an undue weight to opinions which
merely came out in the course of conversation. In fact, Mr. Dunn,&rdquo; said
she, hastily, &ldquo;my father and I differ as to what should constitute the
aristocracy of this kingdom, and from what sources it should be enlisted.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And was used as an illustration?&rdquo; said Dunn, bowing low, but without the
slightest trace of irritation.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You were,&rdquo; said she, in a low but distinct voice.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued he, in the same quiet tone, &ldquo;Lady Augusta Arden
condescended to think and to speak more favorably of the class I belong to
than the Earl her father. Well,&rdquo; cried he, with more energy of manner, &ldquo;it
is gratifying to me that I found the advocacy in the quarter that I wished
it. I can well understand the noble Lord's prejudices; they are not very
unreasonable; the very fact that they have taken centuries to mature, and
that centuries have acquiesced in them, would give them no mean value. But
I am also proud to think that you, Lady Augusta, can regard with
generosity the claims of those beneath you. Remember, too,&rdquo; added he,
&ldquo;what a homage we render to your order when men like myself confess that
wealth, power, and influence are all little compared with recognition by
you and yours.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said she, hesitatingly, &ldquo;you affix a higher value on these
distinctions than they merit.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;If you mean so far as they conduce to human happiness, I agree with you;
but I was addressing myself solely to what are called the ambitions of
life.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I have the very greatest curiosity to know what are yours,&rdquo; said she,
abruptly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mine! mine!&rdquo; said Dunn, stammering, and in deep confusion. &ldquo;I have but
one.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Shall I guess it? Will you tell me, if I guess rightly?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I will, most faithfully.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your desire is, then, to be a Cabinet Minister; you want to be where the
administrative talents you possess will have their fitting influence and
exercise.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, not that!&rdquo; sighed he, heavily.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mere title could never satisfy an ambition such as yours; of that I am
certain,&rdquo; resumed she. &ldquo;You wouldn't care for such an empty prize.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And yet there is a title, Lady Augusta,&rdquo; said he, dropping his voice,
which now faltered in every word,&mdash;&ldquo;there is a title to win which has
been the guiding spirit of my whole life. In the days of my poverty and
obscurity, as well as in the full noon of my success, it never ceased to
be the goal of all my hopes. If I tremble at the presumption of even
approaching this confession, I also feel the sort of desperate courage
that animates him who has but one throw for fortune. Yes, Lady Augusta,
such a moment as this may not again occur. I know you sufficiently well to
feel that when one, even humble as I am, dares to avow&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A quick step in the walk adjoining startled both, and they looked up. It
was Sybella Eellett, who came up with a sealed packet in her hand.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A despatch, Mr. Dunn,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I have been in search of you all over
the garden.&rdquo; He took it with a muttered &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; and placed it unread in
his pocket Miss Eellett quickly saw that her presence was not desired, and
with a hurried allusion to engagements, was moving away, when Lady Augusta
said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Wait for me, Miss Kellett; Mr. Dunn must be given time for his letters,
or he will begin to rebel against his captivity.&rdquo; And with this she moved
away.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pray don't go, Lady Augusta,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I 'm proof against business
appeals to-day.&rdquo; But she was already out of hearing.
</p>
<p>

</div>
<p>
Amongst the secrets which Davenport Dunn had never succeeded in
unravelling, the female heart was pre-eminently distinguished. The veriest
young lady fresh from her governess or the boarding-school would have
proved a greater puzzle to him than the most intricate statement of a
finance minister. Whether Lady Augusta had fully comprehended his
allusion, or whether, having understood it, she wished to evade the
subject, and spare both herself and him the pain of any mortifying
rejoinder, were now the difficult questions which he revolved over and
over in his mind. In his utter ignorance of the sex, he endeavored to
solve the problem by the ordinary guidance of his reason, taking no
account of womanly reserve and delicacy, still less of that &ldquo;finesse&rdquo; of
intelligence which, with all the certainty of an instinct, can divine at
once in what channel feelings will run, and how their course can be most
safely directed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;She must have seen to what I pointed,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I spoke out plainly
enough,&mdash;perhaps too plainly. Was that the mistake I made? Was my
declaration too abrupt? and if so, was it likely she would not have
uttered something like reproof? Her sudden departure might have this
signification, as though to say, 'I will spare you any comment; I will
seem even not to have apprehended you.' In the rank to which she pertains,
I have heard, a chief study is, how much can be avoided of those rough
allusions which grate upon inferior existences; how to make life calm and
peaceful, divesting it so far as may be of the irritations that spring out
of hasty words and heated tempers. In her high-bred nature, therefore, how
possible is it that she would reason thus, and say, 'I will not hurt him
by a direct refusal; I will not rebuke the presumption of his wishes. He
will have tact enough to appreciate my conduct, and return to the topic no
more! 'And yet, how patiently she had heard me up to the very moment of
that unlucky interruption. Without a conscious sense of encouragement I
had never dared to speak as I did. Yes, assuredly, she led me on to talk
of myself and my ambitions as I am not wont to do. She went even further.
She overcame objections which, to myself, had seemed insurmountable. She
spoke to me like one taking a deep, sincere interest in my success; and
was this feigned? or, if real, what meant it? After all, might not her
manner be but another phase of that condescension with which her 'Order'
listen to the plots and projects of inferior beings,&mdash;something
begotten of curiosity as much as of interest?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
In this fashion did he guess and speculate and question on a difficulty
where even wiser heads have guessed and speculated and questioned just as
vaguely.
</p>
<p>
At last he was reminded of the circumstance which had interrupted their
converse,&mdash;the despatch. He took it from his pocket and looked at the
address and the seal, but never opened it, and with a kind of half-smile
replaced it in his pocket.
